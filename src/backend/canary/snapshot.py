"""
Canary snapshot collector (CANARY-001 / Issue #411 — Phase 1).

Gathers a roughly-simultaneous read of orchestration state across:

- SQLite — agent ownership, execution rows (running + queued), plus per-table
  agent_name references for the L-03 orphan scan.
- Redis — agent slot ZSETs (`agent:slots:{name}`).
- Vector logs — deferred to Phase 2; E-02 uses a state-comparison detector
  in this phase (see invariants/e02_no_phantom_reversal.py for rationale).
- Agent registries / container exec — deferred to Phase 2 invariants.

The collector is pure read. It writes nothing. Invariant library functions
take the resulting `Snapshot` and return zero-or-more `ViolationReport`s.

Phase 1 scope is S-01, E-02, L-03 — the rest of the design doc's snapshot
fields are placeholders until their invariants land.

## Why a separate module from the invariants

The three Phase 1 invariants (S-01, E-02, L-03) all read overlapping
state. Splitting state collection out gives three things:

1. **One consistent view per cycle.** All invariants see the same
   `Snapshot` instance, so per-check timing drift cannot introduce
   spurious mismatches — e.g. L-03 reading the SQL `agent_ownership`
   set after S-01 has already started ZRANGEing on agents that were
   live a moment earlier.
2. **No duplicated query code.** New invariants are pure functions
   `(snapshot) → list[ViolationReport]`; they never re-implement
   SELECTs or ZRANGEs against live state. This keeps the registry in
   `invariants/__init__.py` the only file the catalog grows in.
3. **Test-friendly.** Tests pass synthetic `Snapshot` dataclasses
   straight in (see `tests/test_canary_invariants.py`) and never
   need a live Redis or SQLite to exercise the checking logic.

Note: the snapshot is *not* atomic across Redis and SQLite — those
don't share transactions, and our reads are sequential. The harness
deliberately accepts sub-second inconsistencies (a real bug persists
across a 5-minute cycle by definition; transient races self-resolve
and are not what we're trying to catch).
