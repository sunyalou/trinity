B-02 — No queued without slots-full (CANARY-001 / Issue #411 — Phase 3).

If an agent has any queued executions, the system must have a legitimate
reason to keep them queued. There are exactly two legitimate reasons:

1. **Slots are at the cap.** `len(slot_ids excluding sentinels) ==
   max_parallel_tasks` — every drain attempt would correctly fail at
   `acquire_slot`. Working as intended.
2. **A drain tick fired recently.** `CapacityManager.run_maintenance()`
   runs every 60s and writes a heartbeat to `canary:drain_tick_at`. If
   we just ran a drain pass and the queue is still there, the next
   release callback will pick it up; nothing is wedged.

If *neither* holds — there are queued rows, free slots exist, and the
drain tick is stale (>60s old or never written) — the drain pipeline
has stalled. The user's queued task is invisible from their perspective
and the agent looks idle.

## Heartbeat plumbing

The drain-tick timestamp is written by `services/capacity_manager.py:
run_maintenance` at the END of the sweep (not the start), so a crash
mid-sweep leaves the cursor stale and lets this check catch the
breakage. The snapshot reads it via the same Redis client the slot
service uses.

## Grace window

60s matches the call cadence of `main.py`'s maintenance loop. We want
the canary cycle to allow at least one full maintenance interval before
calling drain stalled — otherwise we'd false-fire any time the canary
ran in the small window between an enqueue and the next maintenance
tick. The 5-min canary cadence is well within `60s + maintenance time`.

Tier B, severity critical. A stalled drain is invisible to the user
(no error, just silence) until they notice their queued task never
ran. Catching it on the canary lets the operator intervene.
