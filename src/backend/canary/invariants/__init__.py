"""
Canary invariant library (CANARY-001 / Issue #411).

Each invariant is a pure function `check(snapshot) → list[ViolationReport]`.
The library is registry-driven so the run-cycle endpoint can enable/disable
invariants per request.

Phase 1 (#653) shipped:

- S-01: slot–row bijection (Redis ZSET vs SQL running rows)
- E-02: no phantom state reversal (terminal executions stay terminal)
- L-03: delete cascades (no orphan rows referencing removed agents)

Phase 2 (#882) adds four single-source SQL/Redis checks — same shape as
Phase 1, no new source types:

- S-02: no overbooking (ZCARD ≤ max_parallel_tasks)
- E-01: terminal-state closure (no row past timeout + buffer in `running`)
- E-05: dispatched rows have session (no >60s running row with NULL session)
- B-01: queue-status coherence (`db.get_queued_count` vs id-list count)

Phase 3 (#882, same PR) adds three moderate-complexity checks — each
brings one new piece of plumbing:

- S-03: slot TTL ≥ execution timeout (per-slot Redis TTL lookup)
- B-02: no queued without slots-full (`canary:drain_tick_at` heartbeat)
- R-01: no zombie claude processes (docker exec into agent containers)

Subsequent phases register additional invariants here without changes to
the snapshot collector or the run-cycle endpoint.
