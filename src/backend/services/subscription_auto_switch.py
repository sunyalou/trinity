"""
Subscription Auto-Switch Service (SUB-003).

Automatically switches an agent to a different subscription on the first
subscription failure — either a rate-limit (429) or an auth-class error
(401/403/credit balance/expired token, etc.).

Preconditions (all must be true):
1. Setting "auto_switch_subscriptions" is enabled (default: on, opt-out)
2. Agent has a subscription assigned (not API key)
3. At least one rate-limit / auth event recorded for this (agent, subscription)
4. At least one alternative subscription is available and not rate-limited

Threshold note (#441): pre-#441 we required 2+ consecutive 429s before
switching. That guaranteed at least one user-visible failure on long-running
schedules and never fired on auth-class breakage at all. The 2h skip-list on
alternative selection (`select_best_alternative_subscription` +
`is_subscription_rate_limited`) is what prevents thrashing — see
`tests/unit/test_subscription_auto_switch_pingpong.py` for the regression
tests pinning that contract.

# Concurrent subscription failures on the SAME agent (two chat requests, or a
# chat overlapping a scheduled task) both enter `handle_subscription_failure`
# and, without mutual exclusion, both pick the same alternative, both
# `assign_subscription_to_agent`, and both fire `_restart_agent` — the second
# `container_stop` racing the first `start_agent_internal` wedges the container,
# duplicates the switch notification, or trips the #421 `was_already_running`
# ambiguity. A per-agent lock serializes the read→decide→assign→restart window.
#
# Mirrors the event-loop-safe lazy pattern in `services/agent_call_limiter.py`
# (module dict + a lazily-created guard) rather than `defaultdict(asyncio.Lock)`:
# a defaultdict binds each lock to whatever event loop is current at first key
# access and persists it, which breaks across pytest's per-test loops
# ("Future attached to a different loop"). Creating the locks lazily on the
# running loop avoids that.
#
# INVARIANT: process-local. Correct only while (a) the backend runs a single
# process and (b) the scheduler delegates execution to the backend via
# `/api/internal/execute-task` rather than calling this module in its own
# process — both true today. If the backend ever runs multiple workers, escalate
# to a Redis `SETNX` lock keyed `auto_switch:{agent_name}` (TTL ≥ longest
# plausible container start, ~60s).
