"""
Cleanup Service for Trinity platform.

Background service that periodically cleans up stale resources:
- Reconciles DB execution state against agent process registries (Issue #129)
- Auto-terminates executions exceeding their schedule timeout (Issue #129)
- Marks stale executions (running > threshold) as failed
- Marks stale activities (started > threshold) as failed
- Cleans up stale Redis slots

Runs every 5 minutes with a one-shot startup sweep.
