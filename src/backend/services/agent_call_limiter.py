"""
Backend agent-call budget limiter (#904 RC-1).

Bounds the fan-out of outbound agent HTTP calls from
`task_execution_service.agent_post_with_retry`. Two layered caps:

  * per-agent: how many concurrent backend coroutines may be mid-call
    to a single agent. Default = the agent's `max_parallel_tasks`,
    fallback 3.
  * global: how many concurrent agent calls the backend will hold
    across all agents. Default = `BACKEND_AGENT_CALL_LIMIT` env (8).

Why this exists: every `await` on `httpx.post(agent_url, ...)` is
intermixed with **synchronous** `sqlite3` calls in the surrounding
`task_execution_service.execute_task` (see `db/connection.py:18`).
Sync DB inside an async coroutine stalls the event loop for the
duration of the call — fine for a single short write, but with N
parallel long-running agent calls each emitting periodic
`mark_execution_dispatched` / `log_activity` / `update_execution_status`
writes, the SQLite writer lock + GIL serialise the writes and
starve unrelated handlers (dashboard, healthcheck). The end state
seen in #904: a single misbehaving agent's 11.5-min HTTP call
drove all backend coroutines into sync-DB contention long enough
that the Docker healthcheck (10s) flipped the container to
`unhealthy` and the dashboard's parallel API fan-out timed out.

This module does NOT fix the underlying sync-DB problem — it bounds
how much concurrent agent work the backend will accept so the
event-loop stalls stay short enough that healthcheck + dashboard
keep responding. The proper sync→async-DB migration is a separate
follow-up.

Public API
----------
* ``acquire_agent_call_slot(agent_name)`` — async context manager
* ``BackendAgentCallBudgetExhausted`` — raised when acquire times out

Tunables (env)
--------------
* ``BACKEND_AGENT_CALL_LIMIT`` — int, default 8
* ``BACKEND_AGENT_CALL_QUEUE_TIMEOUT_S`` — float, default 30

# while waiting on the next-hop call which itself wants a slot.
# A finite timeout surfaces such a deadlock as a 503 within an
