Trinity Agent Platform - Backend API

A universal infrastructure platform for deploying Claude Code agent configurations.
Each agent runs as an isolated Docker container with standardized interfaces.

Refactored for better concern separation:
- config.py: Configuration constants
- models.py: Pydantic models
- dependencies.py: FastAPI dependencies (auth)
- services/: Business logic (docker, template)
- routers/: API endpoints organized by domain
- utils/: Helper functions
