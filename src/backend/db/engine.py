"""
SQLAlchemy engine factory — the configurable database backend seam (#300).

`DATABASE_URL` selects the backend at startup:

    sqlite:////data/trinity.db                 (default; derived from TRINITY_DB_PATH)
    postgresql://trinity:secret@postgres:5432/trinity

SQLite stays the zero-config default — nothing changes without DATABASE_URL.

All 44 db modules route through this engine via SQLAlchemy Core. The raw
sqlite3 context manager in `db/connection.py` remains for sqlite-specific
maintenance paths (PRAGMA migrations, WAL checkpoint, VACUUM, the /health
migration gate — all gated to `is_sqlite()` at their call sites) and for the
default-off canary snapshot reader (PG support is a #300 follow-up).
