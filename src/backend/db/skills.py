"""
Agent skills database operations.

Manages skill assignments to agents. Skills themselves are stored in
a GitHub repository; this module only tracks which skills are assigned
to which agents.

Converted from raw sqlite3 to SQLAlchemy Core (#300) so it runs unchanged
on both SQLite and PostgreSQL. Queries are built from the ``agent_skills``
table handle in ``db/tables.py``; the engine is resolved via ``db/engine.py``.
