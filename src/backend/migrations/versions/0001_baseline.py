"""baseline — full head schema (#1183)

The Alembic baseline for the PostgreSQL backend. ``upgrade`` reuses the exact
head-schema DDL that ``db/schema.py:init_schema_postgres`` emits (tables +
indexes + triggers), so a fresh PG database built by ``alembic upgrade head``
is byte-for-byte identical to the pre-Alembic fresh build. A pre-Alembic PG
database (already at this schema) is stamped at this revision instead of
rebuilt — see ``db/alembic_runner.py``.
