"""Regression tests for #671 — cancelled executions reported as `success`.

When the operator cancels a running execution via the UI, two writers race:

  Writer A (terminate handler in routers/chat.py:~1841):
      writes status = CANCELLED into schedule_executions

  Writer B (TaskExecutionService.execute_task success branch:498):
      writes status = SUCCESS once the agent's HTTP response lands —
      the agent often replies 200 because Claude Code catches the cancel
      signal, emits a graceful final message, and exits 0.

Pre-fix CAS (db.schedules.update_execution_status, RELIABILITY-005):
  SUCCESS writes were unconditional ("agent's own completion result always
  wins"). When A landed first and B landed second, B silently clobbered
  the CANCELLED status with SUCCESS. The schedule's `next_run_at`
  advanced as if the run had succeeded; cost telemetry counted the
  partial run as billable success; on-call had no signal that the
  deliverable was incomplete. See issue body for prod repro on
  bdr-agent / `Daily Lead Outreach`.

Post-fix CAS:
  SUCCESS writes are blocked when the row is already CANCELLED. All other
  RELIABILITY-005 invariants (FAILED/CANCELLED/SKIPPED guarded against
  overwriting any terminal) are preserved verbatim.

  Rationale: a user cancel is an authoritative "I no longer want this
  work — its outcome must not be reported as success." Ordering B
  (success lands first, cancel arrives via 'already_finished' branch
  in routers/chat.py) was already protected by the existing terminal
  guard on the cancel-write side.
