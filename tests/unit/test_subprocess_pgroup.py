"""Regression tests for Issue #407: agent-server spin after claude becomes defunct.

The production bug: Claude Code spawns hooks (bash-guardrail.py,
file-guardrail.py, output-scanner.py, …) as subprocesses that inherit the
parent's stdout/stderr pipes. When claude exits but a hook grandchild
outlives it and keeps the write end of a pipe open, our reader's
``readline()`` never sees EOF and the agent-server executor thread wedges
— visibly spinning at ~83% CPU with claude as a ``<defunct>`` zombie.

These tests verify the process-group-based fix in
``docker/base-image/agent_server/utils/subprocess_pgroup.py``:

- ``terminate_process_group`` reaps the full tree (parent + grandchildren)
  so pipe write-ends close and readers unwind.
- ``drain_reader_threads`` kills the group and force-closes pipes when
  readers are stuck after the direct child has exited.
- Helpers are safe to call on already-exited processes.
