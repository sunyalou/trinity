"""
Regression tests for the scheduler sync loop (Issue #420).

The periodic sync loop must be idempotent: if nothing has changed in the DB,
consecutive sync ticks must not re-register jobs. The original bug was a
self-triggering loop where `_add_job` wrote a fresh `updated_at` via
`update_schedule_run_times`, which the next sync tick then interpreted as a
config change and re-added the job — amplifying to N jobs/minute × fleet size.
