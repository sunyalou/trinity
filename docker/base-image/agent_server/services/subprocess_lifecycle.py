"""Subprocess lifecycle helpers for Claude Code execution.

Extracted from `claude_code.py` per #122 (issue split). Wraps the
`utils.subprocess_pgroup` primitives with `_drain_bounded` — a daemon-thread
budgeted variant of `drain_reader_threads` that protects the executor
thread from the TextIOWrapper-lock deadlock described in Issue #728.

Re-exports the four `utils.subprocess_pgroup` helpers used by the chat and
headless paths so callers only need a single import target.

    Prevents a TextIOWrapper lock deadlock in safe_close_pipes (Issue #728)
    from wedging the executor thread for the full task timeout.
    Uses the same asyncio.run() pattern required by drain_reader_threads'
    async-to-sync callers (established in #657); adds a daemon-thread wrapper
    so the budget is enforced at the threading level, not the asyncio level.

    Issue #817: ``execution_tag`` is threaded through to the underlying
    ``drain_reader_threads`` so the env-tag sweep runs after every drain.

    Issue #1025 (salvaged from #980): returns the drain outcome instead of
    ``None`` so the headless orchestrator can detect every case that leaves a
    reader thread still mutating the shared run context, and snapshot its
    finalize-read fields before reading them. Only ``"completed"`` guarantees
    no reader survives:

    - ``"completed"``       — the drain finished within budget AND every
      reader thread passed in has exited.
    - ``"budget_exceeded"`` — the daemon thread did not finish within
      ``_DRAIN_BUDGET_SECONDS`` (the #728 safe_close_pipes deadlock); the
      reader thread is leaked.
    - ``"errored"``         — the drain raised. Previously swallowed with
      ``except Exception: pass``, which masked the failure as a clean
      ``"completed"``; now captured and logged (honours the project-wide
      "never swallow exceptions silently" rule).
    - ``"leaked"``          — the drain returned normally within budget but a
      reader thread is still alive. ``drain_reader_threads`` force-closes the
      pipes and *continues* when a grandchild-held reader won't EOF (its own
      ``outcome=leaked`` METRIC), returning normally — so a within-budget,
      non-raising drain does NOT by itself prove the readers are dead. This
      outcome closes that gap (the #586 leaked-reader case).
