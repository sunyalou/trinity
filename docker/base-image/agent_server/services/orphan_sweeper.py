"""Periodic cgroup orphan sweep — Eugene's fix #2 for Issue #817.

The per-task cleanup in :mod:`subprocess_pgroup` runs the cgroup sweep
from ``drain_reader_threads``'s try/finally. That covers the case where
an execution ends normally (success / timeout / failure) and the
executor gets a chance to clean up.

It does **not** cover Eugene's observed production failure mode:

  1. A long-running execution leaks an orphan.
  2. The Trinity backend's circuit breaker opens because agent-server's
     event loop is starved by the orphan; the backend then terminates
     the execution externally (via Docker / SIGKILL / API call).
  3. ``drain_reader_threads`` never runs — the kill arrives from
     outside agent-server's normal path.
  4. Every subsequent task is fast-failed at the CB layer before
     reaching the agent, so no future per-task cleanup runs either.
  5. The orphan survives for hours and only dies when the operator
     deletes the Redis CB key and restarts the container.

This service breaks that cycle. It runs the same
:func:`kill_cgroup_orphans` on a fixed interval, independent of any
task lifecycle. Once the orphan dies, agent-server's event loop
unsticks, health probes succeed, the backend CB recovers, and normal
operation resumes — all without operator intervention.

The sweep preserves every PID in :class:`ProcessRegistry` (so
in-flight executions are not killed) plus the user-configured cmdline
patterns (so persistent daemons like cornelius-m's moltbook-http-mcp
survive). When nothing is orphaned the sweep is a fast no-op; the
allowed cost of running it every interval is ~one ``/proc`` walk plus
one ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs`` read, both bounded by the number
of processes in the container (typically <30).

Disabled when cgroup v2 unified hierarchy is not available — the
sweep is a no-op there and we don't want to spam logs.
