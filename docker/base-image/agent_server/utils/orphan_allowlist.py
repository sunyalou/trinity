"""Allowlist resolution for the cgroup orphan sweep.

Issue #817 (follow-up): the previous cleanup passes (pgid kill,
pipe-writer sweep, env-tag sweep) each tried to identify orphans by
some artifact they inherited from claude. Production evidence
(Eugene's 2026-05-13 capture on cornelius-m) showed an orphan that
escaped all three — different pgid (setsid), no shared pipes (FDs
detached), no ``TRINITY_EXECUTION_ID`` env tag (env scrubbed).

The only inescapable boundary for a process the container is
attributing CPU to is its cgroup. The new cleanup model is therefore
a single cgroup walk: read ``/sys/fs/cgroup/cgroup.procs`` (cgroup v2
unified hierarchy), then SIGKILL every PID that is NOT on the
allowlist this module produces.

Building the allowlist correctly is the load-bearing part — kill the
wrong PID and the agent-server wedges itself. This module is the
single source of truth for "is PID N allowed to live."

The allowlist composes three sources:

1. **Hard-protected PIDs** — process attributes the platform itself
   needs regardless of any config:
     - PID 1 (the container init / ``/app/startup.sh``)
     - The sweep caller's PID and every PID in its parent chain up to
       PID 1 (covers worker threads calling on behalf of the
       agent-server master process)
     - Every PID whose comm name is ``sshd`` (operator SSH sessions
       must survive a cleanup sweep)

2. **In-flight execution descendants** — for each active claude PID
   passed in ``extra_pids``, the full descendant tree by ppid walk.
   Covers tool subprocesses, MCP server children, hook children
   spawned during that execution.

3. **User-configured persistent patterns** — cmdline glob patterns
   from ``~/.trinity/persistent-processes.allow``. One pattern per
   line; lines starting with ``#`` are comments. Pattern matching uses
   :func:`fnmatch.fnmatchcase` against the full argv joined by spaces.

   This is the escape hatch for templates that legitimately run
   long-lived daemons via ``SessionStart`` hooks (e.g. the
   ``moltbook-http-mcp`` server on cornelius-m). Default file is
   empty; templates that ship persistent daemons must declare them.

The sweep itself lives in :mod:`orphan_sweep`. This module only
computes the set of allowed PIDs.
