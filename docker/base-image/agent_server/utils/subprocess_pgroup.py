"""Process-group lifecycle helpers for Claude Code subprocess management.

Issue #407: Claude Code spawns hooks (bash-guardrail.py, file-guardrail.py,
output-scanner.py, …) as child subprocesses that inherit our stdout/stderr
pipes. If a hook — or any grandchild it forks — outlives claude itself, the
inherited pipe write-ends stay open and our readline() blocks forever, even
though ``claude`` is already a ``<defunct>`` zombie. Result: agent-server
wedges at ~83% CPU and stops serving HTTP.

Fix: launch claude with ``start_new_session=True`` so it becomes its own
process-group leader, and kill the entire group on shutdown. That reaps
hook grandchildren too, which closes the inherited pipe FDs and lets our
reader threads unwind naturally.

Important: the caller must capture the pgid **right after** ``Popen()``
(via ``capture_pgid``) and pass it to every helper that operates on the
group. Once ``process.wait()`` / ``process.poll()`` reaps the parent, the
pid is gone and ``os.getpgid(pid)`` raises — but the process group itself
lives on in the kernel as long as it has any member (the grandchildren we
need to kill).

This module is kept free of package-relative imports so it can be
unit-tested without loading the rest of ``agent_server``.
