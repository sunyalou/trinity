"""Process-group lifecycle helpers for Claude Code subprocess management.

Issue #407: Claude Code spawns hooks (bash-guardrail.py, file-guardrail.py,
output-scanner.py, …) as child subprocesses that inherit our stdout/stderr
pipes. If a hook — or any grandchild it forks — outlives claude itself, the
inherited pipe write-ends stay open and our readline() blocks forever, even
though ``claude`` is already a ``<defunct>`` zombie. Result: agent-server
wedges at ~83% CPU and stops serving HTTP.

Cleanup is a two-step pipeline:

  1. Graceful pgid SIGTERM/SIGKILL of the direct claude process so its
     stream-json output flushes cleanly. (#407)
  2. Cgroup orphan sweep — kill anything in the container cgroup that
     isn't on the allowlist. Replaces the prior three-pass sequence
     (pgid + pipe-writer #618/#728 + env-tag #827) with one inescapable
     mechanism (#817 follow-up). See :mod:`orphan_sweep`.

Important: the caller must capture the pgid **right after** ``Popen()``
(via ``capture_pgid``) and pass it to every helper that operates on the
group. Once ``process.wait()`` / ``process.poll()`` reaps the parent, the
pid is gone and ``os.getpgid(pid)`` raises — but the process group itself
lives on in the kernel as long as it has any member (the grandchildren we
need to kill).

    pipes as a last resort.

    Ordering matters: once all writers (claude + hook grandchildren)
    are dead the kernel will EOF the read end as soon as buffered
    bytes are consumed. If we close our read FD first the reader
    raises ``ValueError: I/O operation on closed file`` and the

    sweep does not depend on it (kept for API stability).

    This function is ``async`` so every ``t.join()`` runs off the
    event-loop thread via ``asyncio.to_thread``. ``asyncio.wait_for``
    enforces the deadline at the event-loop level, preventing the
    asyncio loop from blocking even when orphan subprocesses consume
    all available CPUs and starve ordinary OS-level thread timeouts.
