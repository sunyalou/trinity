# Feature: {Feature Name}

## Overview
Brief description of what this feature does.

## User Story
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].

## Entry Points
- **UI**: `src/frontend/src/views/Component.vue` - Action trigger
- **API**: `METHOD /api/endpoint`

## Frontend Layer
### Components
- `Component.vue:line` - handler() method

### State Management
- `stores/store.js` - action name

## Backend Layer
### Endpoints
- `src/backend/routers/file.py:line` - endpoint_handler()

### Business Logic
1. Step one
2. Step two

## Data Layer
### Database Operations
- Query: Description
- Update: Description

## Side Effects
- WebSocket broadcast: `{type, data}`

## Error Handling
- Error case → HTTP status

## Testing
### Prerequisites
- Services running
- Test user logged in

### Test Steps
1. **Action**: Do X
   **Expected**: Y happens
   **Verify**: Check Z

## How to Create a Flow Document

1. Run `/feature-flow-analysis {feature-name}`
2. Or manually trace: UI → API → Backend → Database → Side Effects
3. Add Testing section with step-by-step verification
4. Update this index after creating

See `docs/TESTING_GUIDE.md` for testing template and examples.
