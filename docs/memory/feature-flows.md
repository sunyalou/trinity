## Recent Updates

| Date | ID | Feature | Flow |
|------|-----|---------|------|
| 2026-06-11 | #858 | fix: first-time setup token silently lost — `docker/backend/Dockerfile` had drifted and lost `ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (which `docker/scheduler/Dockerfile` still set), so CPython block-buffered the lifespan's stdout to the Docker log pipe (~8KB) and the printed setup token never reached `docker logs`, deadlocking fresh installs (the only documented path through the `routers/setup.py` token gate). Two-layer fix: (1) restore `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` (catches every `print()`); (2) the setup-token block + ~76 other lifespan `print()` calls now emit via the structured `logger` — the token as a single multi-line `logger.warning` **relocated to immediately after `setup_logging()`**, before the event-bus/audit-write startup that could otherwise hang and suppress it (the `StreamHandler` flushes per record, so it's immune to future Dockerfile drift and flows through Vector). `setup_opentelemetry()`'s import-time print + the `register_enterprise` prints stay `print(..., flush=True)` (they run before `setup_logging()`). New `unit/test_858_dockerfile_unbuffered.py` backend↔scheduler parity guard (2 tests). Note: stdout→stderr stream move for the converted lines (Docker/Vector capture both). Known follow-up #1165: prod runs uvicorn `--workers 2`, so the per-process token is still ~50% flaky until unified. | [first-time-setup.md](feature-flows/first-time-setup.md) |
| 2026-06-10 | #1130 | fix: retired `gemini-2.0-flash` replaced with env-configurable models — `GEMINI_TEXT_MODEL` (image-gen prompt refinement) + `GEMINI_TRANSCRIPTION_MODEL` (Telegram voice), both default `gemini-3.5-flash`, defined in `config.py`, empty-string-safe wiring in both compose files (#1076 pattern). | [image-generation.md](feature-flows/image-generation.md), [telegram-integration.md](feature-flows/telegram-integration.md) |
| 2026-06-10 | #1108 | feat(ui): Agent Detail **Guardrails** tab renamed to **Settings** — sectioned config home. New `components/settings/SettingsPanel.vue` renders `GuardrailsPanel` unchanged as section #1; future per-agent settings land as additive sections, not new tabs. `?tab=guardrails` deep links alias to `settings` via `TAB_ALIASES`. Pure frontend. | [agent-guardrails.md](feature-flows/agent-guardrails.md) |
| 2026-06-10 | #1114 | feat(ui): Agent Detail tabs overflow into a **"More ▾"** dropdown instead of horizontal scroll. New reusable `components/OverflowTabs.vue` ("priority+" pattern): a hidden, zero-layout mirror row measures every `{id,label,badge?}` tab's width (+ a worst-case "More" button) so the visible row renders as many tabs as fit and collapses the trailing remainder into a right-aligned disclosure menu. Re-measures on container resize (`ResizeObserver` on the outer wrapper, width-diff-guarded + rAF-debounced) and after `document.fonts.ready`; re-measures on tab/label/badge changes via a derived-signature `watch` (`flush:'post'`). Defaults to all-inline before the first measure (no first-paint snap; no "More" when everything fits). Active-in-overflow reflected on the trigger (active underline + dot), tab order never reshuffled. Plain `<button>` disclosure (NOT `role="menu"`): Tab traverses, Escape closes + returns focus, outside-`pointerdown` closes; dark-mode aware. `v-model` over `AgentDetail`'s `activeTab` string ref, so `?tab=` deep-linking is unaffected. Pure frontend; no backend/store changes. Generic enough for `Operations.vue` to adopt next. 6 Playwright e2e behaviors. | [agent-detail-tab-overflow.md](feature-flows/agent-detail-tab-overflow.md), [agent-overview-dashboard.md](feature-flows/agent-overview-dashboard.md) |
| 2026-06-09 | #1109 | refactor(ui): unify Health + Ops + Executions into a single **Operations** nav area — the three separate top-nav entries (Health `/monitoring`, Ops `/operating-room`, Executions `/executions`) collapse into one **Operations** link (`views/Operations.vue`, route `/operations`), a `?tab=`-driven 5-tab view: **Needs Response · Notifications · Health · Executions · Resolved**. `views/OperatingRoom.vue`→`Operations.vue`; Health/Executions content extracted into tab-embeddable `components/MonitoringPanel.vue`/`ExecutionsPanel.vue` (mirroring the #1107 `*Panel.vue` pattern), and the standalone `views/Monitoring.vue`/`views/Executions.vue` deleted. Tabs toggle by `v-if` so each panel's store-owned polling tears down on leave; operator-queue polling stays container-level. **Health** tab is admin-gated at the tab level (`authStore.role === 'admin'`) with non-admin `?tab=health` deep links coerced to the default tab. NavBar carries **one** unified badge (operator-queue + notifications, critical-pulse); the separate Executions running-count badge is dropped (running count lives in the Executions tab strip). Legacy `/monitoring`→`?tab=health`, `/executions`→`?tab=executions`, `/operating-room` (function-form, query-preserving), and `/events`→`?tab=notifications` all redirect. Per-execution detail route (`ExecutionDetail.vue`) unchanged. Pure frontend IA change; no backend endpoints change. | [operating-room.md](feature-flows/operating-room.md), [executions-dashboard.md](feature-flows/executions-dashboard.md), [agent-monitoring.md](feature-flows/agent-monitoring.md) |
| 2026-06-09 | #1107 | feat(ui): Agent Detail **Overview** dashboard as the default landing tab + Info-tab redesign. New `OverviewPanel.vue` leads with About, a compact "needs attention" count+link, and **multi-day trend charts** (executions stacked by user-facing type bucket, terminal success-rate %, duration avg+p95, context) over a 7/14/30-day selector — plus a health panel (current status + heartbeat + restart/OOM; uptime/latency trend lines clamped ≤7d by `agent_health_checks` retention), a recent-activity drill-in, and footprint chips. Strict **non-duplication** of `AgentHeader` (it owns now+cost; Overview owns trend). Charts: `StackedBarChart.vue` (CSS/flexbox — not uPlot bars) + `TrendLineChart.vue` (uPlot, dark-mode-aware, custom cursor tooltip replacing the layout-shifting built-in legend); analogous-cool design-system palette. New agent-scoped analytics endpoint `GET /api/agents/{name}/analytics?window=` (`routers/analytics.py` → `db/schedules.py:get_agent_analytics`) generalises the #868 per-schedule query: `triggered_by` bucketing (+`Other` fallback), **full-set AVG vs sampled p95** correctness, terminal success rate, NULL-skipping context AVG, gap-filled UTC timeline. `executions.js` caches per `${name}:${window}`, never polled. `InfoPanel.vue` leads with About; `template.yaml` metadata behind a collapsible "Technical details". 12 unit tests. | [agent-overview-dashboard.md](feature-flows/agent-overview-dashboard.md), [agent-info-display.md](feature-flows/agent-info-display.md) |
| 2026-06-06 | #1080 | feat: model-list refresh — **Claude Opus 4.8** (`claude-opus-4-8`) added as flagship across `ModelSelector.vue` PRESET + admin platform-default dropdown (`Settings.vue`); the two models retiring 2026-06-15 (`claude-opus-4-20250514`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`) removed from presets; current/legacy tiers relabeled. `TasksPanel.vue` localStorage fallback bumped legacy→`claude-sonnet-4-6`. MCP `model` param examples refreshed (`chat.ts`/`schedules.ts`/`loops.ts`). Backend/agent-server defaults already current (`claude-sonnet-4-6`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) — unchanged, no base-image rebuild. Graceful degradation: a removed preset stays valid free-text until Anthropic's retirement date, then fails with a clear execution error (not silently). Both model test files refreshed. | [model-selection.md](feature-flows/model-selection.md), [scheduling.md](feature-flows/scheduling.md) |
| 2026-06-04 | VOIP-001 (#1056) | VoIP telephony Phase 1 (outbound) — an agent places a phone call over the **unmodified** Gemini Live bridge via Twilio Programmable Voice + Media Streams. New OSS three-layer module (`routers/voip.py` → `services/voip_service.py` → `db/voip.py`) + `voip_bindings`/`voip_call_logs` tables; a Media Streams WS adapter (`adapters/transports/twilio_media_stream.py` + pure `voip_audio.py`) with stateful `audioop` resampling (direct 8k↔16k/24k→8k), paced 160-byte μ-law sender, `clear`-on-barge-in; outbound trigger (REST + MCP `call_user`) with per-`(owner,dest)` rate limit + durable daily cap + Idempotency-Key; call-bound single-use WSS ticket (`ws_ticket_service` gains `ttl_seconds`); two-id namespace (`call_id` vs `vs_`); Redis staged-intent `GETDEL` consume-once; SETNX-guarded transcript save (`source="voice"`); **default-on post-call transcript processing** dispatched to the main agent (`execute_task(triggered_by="voip")`). Feature flag `voip_available` **OFF by default**. `voip_*` tables registered in the agent cascade registry. 27 unit tests; `audioop-lts` pinned for py≥3.13. | [voip-telephony.md](feature-flows/voip-telephony.md) |
| 2026-06-02 | #1033 | Backend prod-image packaging guard — `redis_breaker_util.py` (added by #526) was never added to the Dockerfile's **enumerated** `COPY` list, so it was silently absent from the baked prod image and crash-looped the backend on boot (`ModuleNotFoundError`). No CI caught it: `container-security.yml` boots the **dev** stack (bind-mounts `src/backend`, masking the missing COPY), unit tests run against source, and `docker-compose.prod.yml` has no bind-mount so it only bit on real deploys. Fix: collapse the seven enumerated top-level `COPY` lines to one glob (`COPY ../../src/backend/*.py /app/`) so a new top-level module can never be dropped again; relocate the stray `src/backend/staging-acceptance.py` (#678 test) → `tests/integration/staging_acceptance.py` so the glob only bakes runtime modules. New `backend-image-smoke.yml` CI job exercises the **baked prod image** (no dev bind-mount): asserts the module is present, runs the exact `redis_breaker_util → services.agent_client → main` import chain, and boots `redis`+`vector`+`backend` to a `/health` gate. Path-filtered (not label-gated), least-priv `contents: read`. Server-side counterpart to the `/verify-local` skill. | [backend-image-packaging.md](feature-flows/backend-image-packaging.md) |
| 2026-06-02 | RELIABILITY-006 (#525) | Idempotency keys at trigger boundaries — optional `Idempotency-Key` header at every execution-creating boundary, one execution per `(scope,key)` in 24h, duplicates replay original result + `X-Idempotent-Replay: true` (409 if in-flight), fail-open; new `idempotency_keys` table; Architectural Invariant #18 | [idempotency-keys.md](feature-flows/idempotency-keys.md) |
| 2026-06-02 | GUARD-001/002/003 | Agent guardrails — defense-in-depth safety layer baked into every agent container. Platform baseline (`guardrails-baseline.json`, root-owned 0444): bash deny-list regex, file path deny-list globs, credential output scanner (log-only), turn/timeout/disallowed-tools budgets. Owner-only narrow overrides via `GET/PUT /api/agents/{name}/guardrails` (numeric caps + literal deny lists only; regex + credential scanner not overridable). Injected as `AGENT_GUARDRAILS` env on create/restart, merged into `/opt/trinity/guardrails-runtime.json` by root at boot, enforced via Claude Code PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks + `--max-turns`/`--disallowedTools` CLI flags. Fail-closed throughout. Owner-only Guardrails tab in Agent Detail (`GuardrailsPanel.vue`, #967/#992) edits the turn caps; deny-lists/timeout remain API-only. | [agent-guardrails.md](feature-flows/agent-guardrails.md) |
| 2026-05-30 | #526 | feat(reliability): per-agent **dispatch** circuit breaker (RELIABILITY-007) — producer-side breaker that fast-fails new executions with HTTP 503 (`X-Circuit-Open`/`Retry-After`) when an agent is auth-dead, instead of poisoning the persistent backlog. New `services/dispatch_breaker.py` (consecutive-failure machine, `agent:dispatch:{name}`, **AUTH-only** counting per D10, default threshold 3) reusing the proven `CircuitState` Lua pattern; shared Redis plumbing extracted to top-level `redis_breaker_util.py` (R1: keeps `agent_client`'s standalone-loaded test suites green). `CapacityManager.acquire(breaker_enabled=…)` raises `CircuitOpen` BEFORE the overflow branch (no-enqueue invariant); `task_execution_service` records outcomes at the terminals and backgrounds `db.fail_queued_for_agent` (→FAILED) + audit on `→open`; 60s `run_maintenance` re-drain backstop. Unified `GET/PUT /api/agents/{name}/circuit-breaker` + reset-both; health + `/slots` badge field (pipelined HGETALL, no SCAN); distinct ⚡ "circuit open" badge in `AgentNode`/`AgentHeader`. Per-agent `circuit_breaker_enabled` (default OFF) + global `DISPATCH_BREAKER_ENABLED` master switch = opt-in canary. Exposes `record_failure("missed_heartbeat")` as the #307 seam. 17 unit + 15 integration + 2 fail_queued tests; R1/R2/R3 guards; Playwright badge spec. | [dispatch-circuit-breaker.md](feature-flows/dispatch-circuit-breaker.md), [capacity-management.md](feature-flows/capacity-management.md), [task-execution-service.md](feature-flows/task-execution-service.md) |
| 2026-05-30 | RELIABILITY-004 (#307) | Agent push-heartbeat liveness layer — agent-side 5s loop (`agent_server/heartbeat.py`, gated on `TRINITY_BACKEND_URL`+`TRINITY_MCP_API_KEY`, sleeps-first, swallows all exceptions) POSTs `{memory_mb, active_executions, uptime_s}` to `POST /api/agents/{name}/heartbeat`. Option-B auth: the agent's own agent-scoped MCP key, validated with `track_usage=False` so a 12×/min beat doesn't amplify `usage_count`. Backend `heartbeat_service.py` owns the Redis key family (`agent:heartbeat:{name}` 15s SETEX, persistent `seen` backward-compat hinge, `misses` counter); `heartbeat_status_bulk` (one pipelined round-trip) annotates `GET /api/monitoring/status` with five `heartbeat_*` fields. New backend watch loop (5s, staggered +10s) fires a soft, cooldown-debounced `alert_heartbeat_lost`/`recovered` via `monitoring_alerts` only on the alive→stale (and recovery) transition after a 3-miss guard — writes no health row; the 30s monitoring loop stays authoritative. `clear_heartbeat()` wired into agent delete + rename (the no-TTL `seen` key would otherwise leak). Old-image agents resolve to `unsupported` and are ignored. 5 test files (~1228 lines). | [agent-heartbeat-liveness.md](feature-flows/agent-heartbeat-liveness.md), [agent-monitoring.md](feature-flows/agent-monitoring.md) |
| 2026-05-29 | #950 | deploy-local deferred hardening — `is_trinity_compatible()` now **requires** a non-empty, UTF-8-readable `CLAUDE.md` (blocking 400 `NOT_TRINITY_COMPATIBLE`, previously a non-fatal warning; binary/non-UTF-8 yields a clean 400 not a 500). New `collect_mcp_credential_warnings()` scans `.mcp.json.template`/`.mcp.json` for `${VAR}` refs absent from the post-merge `.env` and not platform-injected (static allowlist mirroring `crud.py`), returning them as advisory `DeployLocalResponse.warnings[]` (also added to the MCP `deploy_local_agent` response type). Docs reconciled: `credentials` request field + `MAX_DEPLOY_CREDENTIALS`, dedicated credential-merge step, `DEPLOYED_TEMPLATES_DIR_UNWRITABLE`/`WORKSPACE_PREPOP_FAILED` codes, `require_role("creator")`. 3 unit-test files. | [local-agent-deploy.md](feature-flows/local-agent-deploy.md), [template-processing.md](feature-flows/template-processing.md) |
| 2026-05-25 | #914 | MCP `chat_with_agent` gateway-timeout receipt — `TrinityClient.chat()` wraps the backend fetch in an `AbortController` bounded by `MCP_CHAT_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 25000ms, under the typical 30-60s MCP gateway ceiling). On abort, `findRecentMcpExecution` queries `/api/agents/{name}/executions` and returns `{status:"queued_timeout", agent, execution_id, message}` so callers poll `get_execution_result` instead of triggering Trinity's concurrent-duplicate guard on retry. New `pickRecentMcpExecution` exported pure helper + 9 `node:test` cases. Live-verified through the FastMCP JSON-RPC transport. Companion to #418 (per-agent execution_timeout enforcement) and the MCP-client surface of #408/#428's long-running dispatch family. | [mcp-orchestration.md](feature-flows/mcp-orchestration.md) |
| 2026-05-25 | #912 | fix(orphan-sweep): drain-time cgroup sweep now forwards an allowlist of in-flight execution pids/pgids so concurrent legitimate claude subprocesses don't get SIGKILLed when a sibling task drains in the same agent cgroup. Single canonical source via `ProcessRegistry.active_execution_pids(exclude_execution_id=…)` — used by the periodic orphan sweeper (#817), `ProcessRegistry.terminate()`, and the new `subprocess_pgroup._active_execution_pids_for_drain()` helper. Fixes the silent SIGKILL of multi-minute tasks visible as "exit code -9 / 0 tool calls / 0 turns" whenever any other task finished in the same container. 8 unit tests + in-container behavioural check. | [execution-termination.md](feature-flows/execution-termination.md), [parallel-headless-execution.md](feature-flows/parallel-headless-execution.md) |
| 2026-05-22 | #868 | feat(analytics): per-schedule execution analytics — `GET /api/agents/{name}/schedules/{id}/analytics` (24h / 7d / 30d) returns counts, success rate, duration p50/p95/p99 (Python `statistics.quantiles`, capped 5000-row pool), cost total, tool-call top-5 weighted by total wall time, UTC daily timeline with gap-fill; `ScheduleAnalyticsCard.vue` (pure-CSS, no Chart.js) inline in `SchedulesPanel.vue` expanded row, threshold-ladder stat tiles, sampled badge; tenant boundary in DB layer (`agent_name` required); per-agent rollup deferred to #18, per-chat-session deferred. 12 unit tests. | [scheduling.md](feature-flows/scheduling.md) |
| 2026-05-20 | #740 | feat: `run_agent_loop` MCP tool + backend loop service — sequential bounded task execution with `{{run}}`/`{{previous_response}}` substitution, optional `stop_signal` early exit, graceful stop. New `agent_loops` + `agent_loop_runs` tables, `loop_id` column on `schedule_executions` for timeline tagging. Cleanup-service startup hook flips orphaned loops to `interrupted`. 16 unit tests. | [run-agent-loop.md](feature-flows/run-agent-loop.md) |
| 2026-05-18 | #887 | fix(read-only): guard moved to base image (`/opt/trinity/hooks/`, root-owned 0555); MultiEdit bypass fixed; fail-closed via `run_hook()`; lifecycle always syncs config on start (stale-volume fix); config file protected by `path_deny` + `bash_deny` in guardrails-baseline.json; 18 unit tests | [read-only-mode.md](feature-flows/read-only-mode.md) |
| 2026-05-18 | #888 | write_user_memory MCP tool — per-user memory write with server-side email resolution, fixing PII cross-user memory leak | [write-user-memory.md](feature-flows/write-user-memory.md) |
| 2026-05-17 | #35d4e78 | fix(credentials): map agent-server connect errors to 503 on `import_credentials` and `export_credentials` — `httpx.RequestError` (ConnectError/TimeoutException/ReadError) now surfaces 503 instead of 500 when the agent container is up but its FastAPI server isn't reachable yet. Mirrors the inject/agent-files pattern. | [credential-injection.md](feature-flows/credential-injection.md) |
| 2026-05-17 | #862 | fix(cleanup): execution retention sweeps were no-ops — `prune_execution_logs`/`prune_execution_rows` queried `status IN ('completed','failed','terminated')` but `TaskExecutionStatus` uses `'success'/'failed'/'cancelled'/'skipped'`; only `'failed'` rows ever pruned; fixed SQL predicates + `idx_executions_completed_terminal` partial index + migration to drop/recreate existing wrong index on live installs | [cleanup-service.md](feature-flows/cleanup-service.md) |
| 2026-05-15 | EXEC-022 (#18) | Unified Executions Dashboard — `GET /api/executions` + `/api/executions/stats` fleet-level endpoints with per-agent access control; `/executions` Vue page with stat cards, filter bar, running strip, load-more; NavBar running-count badge; 30s polling + WS refresh guard | [executions-dashboard.md](feature-flows/executions-dashboard.md) |
| 2026-05-13 | #586 | obs(agent-runtime): `[METRIC] drain_outcome` emissions on the slow path of `drain_reader_threads` — two reachable sites surface `outcome=natural`/`force_close`/`leaked`, `stuck_initial`, `drain_elapsed_ms`, optional `leaked_count`, plus vestigial `orphan_kill_count=0` (since the #817 cgroup-sweep refactor, actual orphan counts are logged separately as `Cgroup sweep killed N orphan(s)`). Fast path stays silent. New Stop-hook authoring guidance in `TRINITY_COMPATIBLE_AGENT_GUIDE.md` shows how to release the inherited stdout FD before blocking I/O so hooks avoid the slow path entirely. Fleet audit at `scripts/586-fleet-check.sh` gates close-out by scanning Vector agent logs for residual "still stuck after Ns" / "no result message after" events. 2 new unit tests. | [execution-termination.md](feature-flows/execution-termination.md) |
| 2026-05-13 | #602/#830 | sec: drop SYS_PTRACE / MKNOD / NET_RAW / FSETID from `FULL_CAPABILITIES` (Phase 3c). SYS_PTRACE closes the AISEC-C2 heap-read OAuth-exfil path. FULL set is now 9 caps (was 13). Constants extracted to stdlib-only `services/agent_service/capabilities.py`; `lifecycle.py` re-exports. | [container-capabilities.md](feature-flows/container-capabilities.md), [agent-lifecycle.md](feature-flows/agent-lifecycle.md) |
| 2026-05-13 | #831 | feat: platform default model — admin sets `platform_default_model` in Settings General tab; `task_execution_service.execute_task()` resolves `model=None` → platform default (TTL-cached, write-through invalidation); `GET /api/settings/feature-flags` exposes value for frontend; SchedulesPanel shows "platform default (X)" when no model set; PRESET_MODELS updated to canonical Anthropic list (Opus 4.7 / Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5) | [model-selection.md](feature-flows/model-selection.md), [platform-settings.md](feature-flows/platform-settings.md), [task-execution-service.md](feature-flows/task-execution-service.md) |
| 2026-05-12 | #808 | fix(orphan-killer): `_set_idle_priority()` (SCHED_IDLE/nice) + `_scan_deadline` 8s per-iteration budget — prevents orphan-killer daemon thread from starving uvicorn health probes on 1-CPU containers and triggering circuit breaker | [parallel-headless-execution.md](feature-flows/parallel-headless-execution.md) |
| 2026-05-12 | #474 | fix(circuit-breaker): only TCP unreachability counts toward the circuit — `agent_client._request()` now classifies via shared `is_circuit_failure()` helper backed by `CIRCUIT_FAILURE_EXCEPTIONS` (`ConnectError`, `ConnectTimeout`). `TRANSIENT_TRANSPORT_EXCEPTIONS` (`ReadTimeout`/`WriteTimeout`/`PoolTimeout`/`WriteError`/`ReadError`/`RemoteProtocolError`) still raise `AgentNotReachableError` but no longer increment the 3-failure threshold; raw `OSError` subclasses (`BrokenPipeError`/`ConnectionResetError`) propagate uncaught; `asyncio.CancelledError` is re-raised explicitly. `monitoring_service.check_network_health()` lazy-imports the same tuples so the /health probe and inline `/api/*` agree on what "unreachable" means; any HTTP response (200..599) records success — symmetric with `_request()` so stale counters clear. `aggregate_health()` adds explicit `status_code >= 500 → UNHEALTHY` branch so a wedged-but-listening agent isn't silently HEALTHY under the new rule. 12 unit + 13 integration tests on the classifier + 1 new monitoring-service integration suite. | [agent-monitoring.md](feature-flows/agent-monitoring.md), [execution-queue.md](feature-flows/execution-queue.md), [scheduling.md](feature-flows/scheduling.md) |
| 2026-05-11 | #759 | fix(session-tab): reattach to in-flight turn after KeepAlive deactivation — new `session_inflight:{session_id}` Redis sentinel (covers cold + warm turns) drives `turn_in_progress` field on GET sessions/{id}; old static 300s lock TTL replaced with dynamic per-agent `execution_timeout + 30s` (capped 7230s) so >5-min turns don't drop the lock mid-flight; lock key extracted to `_session_lock_key()` helper. Frontend `inFlightBySession`/`errorBySession`/`fallbackNoticeBySession` move from local refs to Pinia store keyed by sessionId (fixes cross-agent state bleed); `onActivated` reattaches via polling (2s→5s→15s backoff, 60-attempt cap); optimistic insert dropped — `loadSession` is the canonical source. 13 AST/structural unit tests. Cold-turn JSONL race tracked separately as #779. | [session-tab.md](feature-flows/session-tab.md) |
| 2026-05-08 | #692 | sec/config: close `changeme` propagation paths — prod compose `ADMIN_PASSWORD`/`TRINITY_PASSWORD` switch to fail-loud `${VAR:?...}`; MCP server drops `\|\| "changeme"` fallback and throws on startup when no usable cred in legacy non-API-key mode; `gcp-deploy.sh` refuses to write `.env` when `ADMIN_PASSWORD` is unset or literally `"changeme"`; `deploy.config.example` drops `"changeme"` default; `.env.example` collapses duplicate `FRONTEND_URL` and adds `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `LOG_*`, `TRINITY_DATA_PATH`, `HOST_TEMPLATES_PATH`. Default `MCP_REQUIRE_API_KEY=true` mode unaffected. | [mcp-orchestration.md](feature-flows/mcp-orchestration.md) |
| 2026-05-08 | #708 | fix(slack): startup recovery supervisor — when ALL initial Socket Mode connect attempts fail at backend boot (e.g. transient DNS slowness exceeds the 10s connect ceiling), `start()` now spawns a recovery supervisor that retries with the watchdog's exponential backoff (60→120→240→300s cap) until at least one client connects, then graduates to the per-client watchdog model. Pre-#708 behavior was a silent permanent-offline state with no retry path. `stop()` cancels the supervisor cleanly so admin-disconnect / shutdown stays bounded. main.py keeps the transport reference even on initial failure so the supervisor's task isn't orphaned. Bad-creds case (typo/expired/revoked token): supervisor retries forever but backend HTTP stays fully responsive — ERROR log "STARTUP UNREACHABLE" fires after 3 consecutive failures for operator paging. Bad-format token (no `xapp-` prefix) takes the existing early-return path — no supervisor, no retry. 10 new unit tests + 1 flipped existing test. | [slack-channel-routing.md](feature-flows/slack-channel-routing.md) |
| 2026-05-06 | #244 | fix(slack): multi-connection Socket Mode — N concurrent WebSockets (default 2, env `SLACK_SOCKET_CONNECTION_COUNT` clamped 1–10) per Slack's documented multi-connection guidance, eliminating the brief reconnect gap when one client half-closes. Each client gets an independent watchdog with its own backoff counter; envelope-ID dedup ring (OrderedDict cap 1024 + `asyncio.Lock`) defends against possible cross-connection duplicate delivery and emits a measurable `dedup_hits` counter. `is_connected` returns "any client healthy" and a new `connected_count` exposes degraded mode. 56 unit tests pass. Reconnect-call timeout deferred to #683. | [slack-channel-routing.md](feature-flows/slack-channel-routing.md) |
| 2026-05-05 | #453 | sec: Encrypt SLACK-001 bot tokens at rest — `db/slack.py` adopts the AES-256-GCM JSON-envelope pattern from `slack_channels.py`/`telegram_channels.py`/`whatsapp_channels.py`. New `_migrate_slack_bot_token_encryption` walks BOTH `slack_link_connections` and `slack_workspaces` and re-encrypts any plaintext `xoxb-*` rows. Read-path plaintext fallback keeps runtime working pre-migration. Architecture Invariant #12 reworded to acknowledge the documented exception (channel/subscription tokens persisted but mandatorily encrypted). 14 unit tests. Test backfill for slack_channels.py + TG + WA tracked in #664. | [slack-integration.md](feature-flows/slack-integration.md) |
| 2026-05-17 | #865 (revert SITE-001) | Remove agent website reverse-proxy (`routers/site.py`, `SITE_PORT`, nginx `/site/` block, frontend "Website" link-type option); `link_type='site'` creation now returns 400. DB schema column kept for SITE-002 companion redesign. | [public-agent-links.md](feature-flows/public-agent-links.md) |
| 2026-05-03 | #250 | Token usage display — per-agent cost/token stats (24h, 7d, lifetime) from `schedule_executions` DB, shown in AgentHeader as amber sparkline + today's cost + trend vs 7-day average | [token-usage-display.md](feature-flows/token-usage-display.md) |
| 2026-05-01 | SESSION_TAB_2026-04 | Session tab — `--resume`-default chat surface. New `agent_sessions`/`agent_session_messages` tables, six `/api/agents/{name}/sessions*` endpoints, `SessionPanel.vue` + `stores/sessions.js`, parser fix + `persist_session` plumbed through agent stack, resume-failure fallback, Redis lock per `(agent, claude_uuid)`, JSONL cleanup service, JSONL fallback recovery for stdout pipe race, JSONL-side compact event capture, validator canonical-trinity allowance. Default ON since GA 2026-05-04 (`session_tab_enabled` flag, settable to false to disable). | [session-tab.md](feature-flows/session-tab.md) |
| 2026-05-01 | #293 | fix(slack): replace `slackify-markdown 0.2.2` with own `services.slack_mrkdwn` renderer — fixes 5 layout bugs that produced "ugly" output: nested-list flattening, headings crammed against preceding content, blockquote `>` only on first line, raw-pipe table passthrough, dropped `---` rules. 35 unit tests + 13 ported. | [slack-channel-routing.md](feature-flows/slack-channel-routing.md) |
| 2026-04-29 | #584 | feat(slack): UI + API to change Slack DM-default agent — `set_slack_dm_default()` DB method (single-tx clear-then-set), `PUT /api/agents/{name}/slack/channel/dm-default` (owner-only, audit-logged), "Make default" button + tooltip in `SlackChannelPanel.vue`, unbind refuses 409 when target is DM default with siblings remaining | [slack-channel-routing.md](feature-flows/slack-channel-routing.md) |
| 2026-04-30 | #598 | sec: AISEC-C2 Layer 2 — restored `.mcp.json` post-deploy editing via structure validation (`services.mcp_validator`). Closed schema, command/transport allowlists, SSRF guard for http/sse, reserved env-ref blocklist, literal-secret detection. 88 unit tests + 22 integration tests. UI placeholder updated; `trinity` server name reserved. | [credential-injection.md](feature-flows/credential-injection.md) |
| 2026-04-30 | #590 | sec: AISEC-C2 Layer 1 — backend `ALLOWED_CREDENTIAL_PATHS` tightened; backend `update_agent_file_logic` adds defense-in-depth deny check before proxy; agent-server `EDIT_PROTECTED_PATHS` adds `.mcp.json` and `.credentials.enc`. | [credential-injection.md](feature-flows/credential-injection.md), [file-browser.md](feature-flows/file-browser.md) |

| 2026-04-27 | #539 | fix: public chat context duplication — `build_public_chat_context()` now called before `add_public_chat_message(role="user")`, preventing current message appearing twice in every agent prompt | [public-agent-links.md](feature-flows/public-agent-links.md) |

| 2026-04-26 | #516, #520 | Agent error classification — `_classify_signal_exit()` (504 for SIGINT/SIGKILL/SIGTERM, was misread as 503 auth) and `_classify_empty_result()` (502 when clean exit drops the final result message, was silent 200 + watchdog reap) | [parallel-headless-execution.md](feature-flows/parallel-headless-execution.md), [task-execution-service.md](feature-flows/task-execution-service.md) |
| 2026-04-26 | #498 | Sync `/task` long-poll on backlog — sync parallel calls at capacity now spill to BACKLOG-001 (same backlog as async) and long-poll the open HTTP connection until terminal status (cap `2 × effective_timeout`); new `services/sync_waiter.py` owns the in-process registry + event/poll-fallback wait helper | [persistent-task-backlog.md](feature-flows/persistent-task-backlog.md), [parallel-headless-execution.md](feature-flows/parallel-headless-execution.md) |
| 2026-04-24 | FILES-001 (#295) | Outbound file sharing — per-agent opt-in publish volume, `share_file` MCP tool, public download URL (`?sig=` token), UI panel with toggle/list/revoke. Agents publish files to `/home/developer/public/`; backend extracts via Docker SDK `get_archive` on demand; URL format `/api/files/{id}?sig={token}` | [file-sharing-outbound.md](feature-flows/file-sharing-outbound.md) |

| 2026-04-25 | #487 | Telegram file upload Phase 2 — workspace delivery hardening: NFKC sanitizer with collision dedup, spec injection format `[File uploaded by {uploader}]: {name} ({size}) saved to {path}`, all-writes-failed channel error + abort.

| 2026-04-22 | SCHED-COND-001 (#454) | Conditional schedule pre-check — backend `docker exec`s the template's executable `~/.trinity/pre-check` (language-agnostic, interpreter from shebang) before scheduler fires a cron chat; empty stdout + exit 0 records a skipped execution; fail-open; reuses `ExecutionStatus.SKIPPED` (no schema change, no HTTP edge from scheduler to agent) | [scheduler-pre-check.md](feature-flows/scheduler-pre-check.md) |

| 2026-04-20 | #418 | Inter-agent timeout honors per-agent `execution_timeout_seconds` — removed 600s hardcoded defaults in MCP `chat_with_agent`/`fan_out` tools and fan-out service; HTTP client ceiling bumped to platform max (7200s) | [fan-out.md](feature-flows/fan-out.md), [mcp-orchestration.md](feature-flows/mcp-orchestration.md), [parallel-headless-execution.md](feature-flows/parallel-headless-execution.md) |
