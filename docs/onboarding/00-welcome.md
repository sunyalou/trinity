# Welcome to Trinity 🚀

**Autonomous agent orchestration and infrastructure**

Trinity transforms the way you deploy and manage autonomous AI agents. Whether you're building a single intelligent assistant or orchestrating a network of specialized agents working together, Trinity provides the infrastructure you need.

---

## What is Trinity?

Trinity is a **sovereign infrastructure platform** for deploying, orchestrating, and governing autonomous AI agents. Agents can:

- 🎯 **Plan independently** — Break down complex goals into executable tasks
- 🧠 **Remember persistently** — Store knowledge across sessions using vector databases
- 🤝 **Collaborate autonomously** — Delegate work to specialized sub-agents
- ⏰ **Run on schedules** — Execute workflows without human intervention
- 📊 **Learn from experience** — Build semantic memory over time
- 🔄 **Recover from failures** — Handle errors and continue execution
- 🔀 **Multi-runtime support** — Choose between Claude Code or Gemini CLI per agent

---

## Who Should Use Trinity?

Trinity is designed for:

### Developers & Engineers
Build sophisticated AI applications with multi-agent workflows, automated pipelines, and intelligent automation.

### Business Teams
Deploy AI assistants that manage your workflows: content creation, customer support, research coordination, data analysis.

### Researchers & Innovators
Experiment with autonomous agent architectures, test new AI patterns, and push the boundaries of what's possible.

## Core Capabilities

### 🔀 Multi-Runtime Support
Choose the best AI runtime for each agent:
- **Claude Code** — Anthropic's powerful reasoning model (200K-1M context)
- **Gemini CLI** — Google's fast, cost-effective model (1M context, free tier available)

Mix and match runtimes in your agent fleet — they can communicate seamlessly via MCP.

### 🐳 Isolated Agent Containers
Every agent runs in its own Docker container with dedicated resources, ensuring stability and security.

### 📝 Template-Based Deployment
Create agents from pre-configured templates or build your own. Deploy in seconds with GitHub integration.

### 🔄 Agent-to-Agent Communication
Agents can message each other, share files, and coordinate work through fine-grained permission controls.

### 🗄️ Persistent Memory
Each agent has a Chroma vector database for semantic memory that survives restarts.

### ⏰ Autonomous Scheduling
Set cron-based schedules for agents to run workflows automatically without human intervention.

### 📁 Shared Folders
Agents share data via Docker volumes — perfect for exchanging files, state, and coordination data.

### 🔑 Secure Credential Management
Store API keys and secrets centrally with hot-reload capability. No hardcoded credentials.

### 📊 Real-Time Monitoring
Beautiful web dashboard shows agent activity, context usage, and inter-agent communications.

### 🔧 Trinity MCP Server
External tools can orchestrate your agents via the Model Context Protocol — 16+ tools available.

### 📈 OpenTelemetry Integration
Track costs, token usage, and performance metrics across your agent fleet.

## The Trinity Philosophy

### Start Simple, Scale Thoughtfully
Begin with a single agent. Only add more agents when you have clear evidence that specialization or parallelization would help.

### Domain Logic in Agents, Infrastructure in Platform
Your agents focus on their domain expertise. Trinity handles orchestration, memory, scheduling, and communication.

### Loose Coupling, High Cohesion
Agents should work independently but coordinate effectively. Design for failure — agents should handle missing data gracefully.

### Observable and Debuggable
Every interaction is logged. Every state change is traceable. You should always know what your agents are doing and why.

## Quick Start Journey

Here's what your first few days with Trinity might look like:

### Day 1: Setup & First Agent
- Install Trinity on your machine
- Create your first agent from a template
- Chat with your agent and see it respond
- Explore the dashboard and understand the UI

### Day 2: Customize & Schedule
- Edit your agent's instructions (CLAUDE.md)
- Add API credentials for external services
- Create a schedule for autonomous execution
- Watch your agent run tasks automatically

### Day 3: Multi-Agent System
- Deploy a second specialized agent
- Configure permissions for agent-to-agent communication
- Set up shared folders for data exchange
- Watch agents coordinate on a workflow

### Week 2: Production System
- Build a complete multi-agent system for your use case
- Set up monitoring and alerts
- Configure production credentials
- Deploy autonomous workflows
