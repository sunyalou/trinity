# Orchestration & Multi-Agent Reliability Plan

**Date:** 2026-04-13 (revised 2026-04-20, 2026-04-26)
**Status:** Proposed sequencing for execution-time orchestration, event subscriptions, and multi-agent reliability.

**Progress:** Sprint A — **7/7 complete**. Sprint B — **1/1 complete**. Sprint C — **5/5 complete**: #260 (PR #316), #271 (PR #332), #264 (PR #334), #291 (PR #484). **#294 closed** without implementation (pause rationale vindicated — see Sprint C row). Sprint D — **3/4 complete: #306 + #430 + #428 shipped.** Sprint D′ — **1/3 complete: #524 shipped (minimal scope — CAS guard + state machine doc; full projector deferred).** **Next: #429 (CLEANUP-COLLAPSE) after #428 soak, plus #525/#526 in parallel.**

**2026-04-20 revision:** After reviewing the accumulated orchestration surface (three queue abstractions, nine cleanup paths, twelve status-column writers, seven dispatch sites), the next priority shifted from finishing Sprint C to **push-based completion (#306) + consolidation** — see *Tier 2.5 — Simplification* below. The cleanup pyramid is load-bearing, so simplification is **additive-first**: new paths ship alongside old ones and the watchdog is retired only after push has soaked.

---

## Problem statement

Trinity has accumulated ~20 issues touching execution-time orchestration. They exist because the current design has **parallel code paths for the same logical operation** (sync chat, async task, scheduler, fan-out, event subscriptions) that drift apart, and because **state-corruption bugs at the bottom of the stack** (orphaned processes, lost error context, fixed slot TTLs) make higher-level features unreliable.

BACKLOG-001 (#260) is the marquee item, but it can't land cleanly until:
1. The async execution path is unified with `TaskExecutionService` (#95).
2. The lower-level bugs are fixed so the backlog doesn't inherit them.

Shipping #260 on top of today's foundation would produce a *persistent* backlog of *corrupt* executions.

---

## Sequencing

```
Sprint A (unblock):     #95 ✅, #285 ✅, #226 ✅, #286 ✅, #61 ✅, #132 ✅, #56 ✅  ← COMPLETE
Sprint B (trace):       #305 ✅  ← COMPLETE
Sprint C (orchestrate): #260 ✅ → #271 ✅ → #264 ✅ → #294 🚫 → #291 ✅
Sprint D (simplify):    #306 ✅ → #428 (CAPACITY-CONSOLIDATE) → #429 (CLEANUP-COLLAPSE)
                        #430 ✅ (parallel — process engine deleted; archive on branch archive/process-engine)
                        (and #408 dissolves once #428 lands — verified 2026-04-24: long-running call still present, #306 alone insufficient)
Sprint D′ (harden):     #524 (state machine) → unblocks #429's terminal-writer guarantee
                        #525 (idempotency keys) — parallel
                        #526 (dispatch circuit breaker) — parallel; better with #307
Sprint E (telemetry):   #307
Sprint F (scale):       #24, #18
```

`#95` lands alone because every other Tier 0 fix layers on top of the unified executor. The remaining Tier 0 issues are independent and can parallelize once `#95` ships.

### Dependency edges to enforce on the board

- ~~`#260 blocked-by #95`~~ — #95 and #260 shipped.
- ~~`#271 blocked-by #285`~~ — #285 and #271 shipped.
- `#294 blocked-by #95` — validation session reuses the unified execution path. #95 shipped; #294 unblocked.
- ~~`#260 blocks #271, #294, #264`~~ — #260 shipped. #294 and #264 now unblocked.
- ~~`#294` and `#264` are independent — parallelize them.~~ #264 shipped.

### Merge candidates (single PR surface)

- ~~**#226 + #61**~~: #226 shipped (PR #323). #61 remains — wire backend cleanup into agent's existing terminate endpoint.
- **#305**: tracing. Can now build on #286's preserved error context (shipped in PR #324) — trace ID can be appended to the combined error message.

---

## Target architecture: actor model (destination)

**Added 2026-04-26.** The tier-by-tier work above is the *path*. This section names the *destination* so each step has a coherent direction. Not a rewrite proposal — most components already exist in the right shape; they're wired as fallbacks rather than as the primary path.

**The destination is the actor model.** Each agent is an actor with:

1. **A mailbox** — durable per-agent inbox. Other agents and external triggers drop messages here. The mailbox *is* the queue; there is no separate dispatch path.
2. **A journal** — append-only record in the agent's git repo. Replayable. Source of truth for "what happened to this agent," not a central platform table.
3. **A processor** — pulls from mailbox, executes, appends to journal, emits reply messages. Configurable parallelism regulates throughput.

The platform's job collapses to four things: deliver messages, supervise actors, project journals into observability (UI, audit), and translate human-facing sync (chat, webhook) into async messages via edge adapters.

### Why this is reachable, not a rewrite

| Actor model concept | Trinity component today | Gap to close |
|---|---|---|
| Mailbox | `BacklogService` (SQLite FIFO) | Today fires only on overflow — make it the only path in |
| Processor + parallelism | `SlotService` (Redis ZSET) | Already correct in shape; becomes inbox consumer rate |
| Journal | Agent git repo + `~/.trinity/operator-queue.json` | Generalize: every workflow checkpoint commits to repo |
| Message transport | `EventBus` / Redis Streams (#306) | Add typed message envelope |
| Single-writer state | `ExecutionStateProjector` (#524) | Projector = journal-to-DB mapping |
| At-least-once delivery | Idempotency keys (#525) | Required by the protocol |
| Per-actor health gate | Dispatch circuit breaker (#526) | Stops feeding mailboxes of dead actors |
| Auto-scaling signal | Inbox depth | Falls out for free once mailbox is the only path |

Rewiring, not rebuilding. Nothing on this list gets thrown away.

### Transition roadmap (gated, evidence-driven)

**Phase 1 — Ship Sprint D + D′ as planned.** Every issue in those sprints (#428, #429, #524, #525, #526) bends the architecture toward the actor model. **Do not pause to redesign — this *is* the path.**

**Phase 2 — Prove the model on one boundary.** Pick the smallest, lowest-risk surface: **MCP `chat_with_agent` (agent → agent only)**. Route it through `BacklogService` as a typed message instead of as a sync HTTP call. One sprint. Same agent code on both sides. Human-facing `/chat` untouched.

**Phase 3 — Decision gate.** Read the result honestly:
- If message-passing is clearly simpler (fewer slots/timeouts/cleanup paths) and latency is acceptable → fold next boundary (`/task`, then schedules, then webhooks).
- If hidden complexity surfaces (backpressure, discovery, debugging) → stay on the planned path. Sprint D + D′ still leaves the system in a much better place than today.

**Phase 4 — Human chat stays sync via edge adapter.** WebSocket holds open, drops a message in the agent's inbox, waits for the reply, forwards it. Looks sync to the human; underneath it's async. Sync semantics live in a thin shim, not in the core.

### Non-goals (explicitly)

- Flag-day rewrite. The current platform stays load-bearing throughout.
- Replacing components that already work in actor-shape (`SlotService`, `EventBus`, `BacklogService`).
- Touching human-facing chat UX. Edge-adapter latency is acceptable; redesigning browser interactions is not on the table.

### Pre-experiment artifact

Before scheduling Phase 2, write one page with two sections:

1. **Message envelope** — fields every inter-agent message carries (e.g., `id`, `from`, `to`, `correlation_id`, `causation_id`, `kind`, `payload`, `idempotency_key`, `deadline`).
2. **Journal format** — what the agent appends to its repo per processed message (`journal.ndjson`? structured `state.yaml` per workflow?).

If both fit cleanly on a postcard, the model is sound and Phase 2 proceeds. If either sprawls, the model isn't ready and the planned path remains the best one available.

**Pre-postcard work**: `ParallelTaskRequest` has 15 fields, 12 of them conditional. Until those are demoted (to session/agent state, envelope headers, or out-of-band storage) or explicitly quarantined, the postcard cannot fit honestly. The demotion sequence is six small PRs documented in `ACTOR_MODEL_TASK_DEMOTION_MAP.md` — execute that first, then #945 becomes a 30-minute writeup of what shipped.

---

## Tier 0 — Fix state-corruption bugs (Sprint A)

**Goal:** Make execution state authoritative and correct. No new features.

| # | Title | Why it's here |
|---|-------|---------------|
| ~~#95~~ ✅ | ~~Route async task mode through `TaskExecutionService`~~ | **Shipped** on `feature/95-unified-async-executor`. `_execute_task_background()` deleted. Async `/task` now delegates to `execute_task(slot_already_held=True)` via `_run_async_task_with_persistence` thin wrapper. 429-upfront preserved via router-side pre-acquire. Service gained `parent_activity_id`, `extra_activity_details`, `slot_already_held` params. Sync+async share `_persist_chat_session` helper. E3 fix: `subscription_id` now snapshotted on pre-created execution record. |
| ~~#285~~ ✅ | ~~Expired subscription tokens cause hour-long zombie executions~~ | **Shipped** in PR #322. Added stderr scanner in `TaskExecutionService` that detects auth failure patterns (`unauthorized`, `invalid.*token`, `expired.*credential`, etc.) and aborts early. Execution marked failed with `auth_failure` error type. No more hour-long zombies from expired tokens. |
| ~~#61~~ ✅ | ~~Backend cleanup doesn't invoke agent termination~~ | **Shipped** in PR #326. Added `terminate_execution_on_agent()` helper to `TaskExecutionService` that calls agent's `/api/executions/{id}/terminate` endpoint. Wired into timeout handler and cleanup service slot reclaim path. Best-effort with watchdog safety net. 8 unit tests. |
| ~~#226~~ ✅ | ~~Stale-slot cleanup ignores per-agent TTL on the standalone path~~ | **Shipped** in PR #323. `cleanup_stale_slots()` now accepts `agent_timeouts` dict and uses per-agent TTL (timeout + 5min buffer) instead of fixed 20-min default. Cleanup service passes `db.get_all_execution_timeouts()` to slot service. |
| ~~#286~~ ✅ | ~~Cleanup overwrites real error~~ | **Shipped** in PR #324. Added `/api/executions/{id}/last-error` agent endpoint + `ProcessRegistry.get_last_error()` to extract error from log buffer. `_recover_execution()` now fetches original error before marking failed, combines with cleanup reason (`"{original}. Cleanup: {reason}"`), sanitizes via `sanitize_text()`, truncates to 2000 chars. No schema change needed — reuses existing `error` column with richer content. |
| ~~#132~~ ✅ | ~~APScheduler skips triggers when `max_instances=1` reached~~ | **Shipped** in PR #328. True fire-and-forget: `_call_backend_execute_task()` now spawns `asyncio.create_task(_poll_and_finalize())` and returns immediately with `"dispatched"` status. Job function no longer blocks on polling, so APScheduler doesn't skip subsequent triggers. `last_run_at` updated immediately on dispatch (not completion) for missed-schedule detection. Background tasks tracked in `_active_poll_tasks` set for graceful shutdown. 4 new tests in `test_async_dispatch.py`. |
| ~~#56~~ ✅ | ~~Consistent context usage tracking~~ | **Shipped** in PR #329. Fixed `TaskExecutionService` to use `input_tokens` only (not `input+output`). Per Claude Code SDK, `input_tokens` represents the full context window fill level including accumulated tool results. `AgentClient` already had the correct pattern. |

### Architectural shift

**Before:** Two execution code paths (sync + async) with duplicated slot/activity/sanitization logic. Backend cleanup doesn't call the agent's existing terminate endpoint, leaving processes running. Cleanup overwrites diagnostic data. Scheduler skips triggers silently when prior runs overlap.

**After:** Single `TaskExecutionService` funnel. Backend timeout calls agent terminate → existing SIGINT→SIGKILL path runs. Slot TTL comes from per-slot metadata on every cleanup path. Cleanup preserves original error by fetching from agent log buffer and combining with cleanup reason in `error` field (no schema change). Scheduler uses true fire-and-forget: job function returns immediately after dispatch, background task polls and publishes events.

### Verification gates before exiting Tier 0

- ✅ Grep for `_execute_task_background` returns zero hits outside docs (shipped in #95). Shadow-run deemed unnecessary for the async-path refactor: sync-mode already delegated to `execute_task()` pre-#95, and public/internal async paths had been using the same `execute_task(execution_id=...)` pattern in production; the refactor is a code-path unification rather than a semantics change. Parity tests cover the two observable invariants (429-upfront, `parallel_mode` activity flag).
- Integration test: force a 5-second timeout on a real agent task, assert (a) zero orphan `claude` processes inside the container, (b) execution row `error` field contains both original error context and cleanup reason (combined format), (c) slot is released within TTL+buffer.
- ✅ Execution `error` field now contains combined message: original error from agent log buffer + cleanup reason. Sanitized and truncated to 2000 chars (#286 shipped).
- ✅ Scheduler job function returns immediately after dispatch (#132 shipped). Skips prevented by true fire-and-forget: polling moved to background task. 127 scheduler tests pass.

---

## Tier 1 — Tracing (Sprint B)

**Goal:** Get a single trace ID across hops before shipping orchestration features, so failures are diagnosable. Heartbeat and WS rewrite are deferred to Sprint D — they're bigger surfaces than #260 itself, and gating reliability work on a WebSocket rewrite is the wrong tradeoff.

| # | Title | Why it's here |
|---|-------|---------------|
| ~~#305~~ ✅ | ~~OpenTelemetry distributed tracing (RELIABILITY-002)~~ | **Shipped** in PR #330. Auto-instrumentation for FastAPI/httpx/Redis. Trace ID in logs. 10% default sampling. Enabled via `OTEL_ENABLED=1`. |

### Considerations

- **Sampling**: start at 10% for high-volume endpoints. Full sampling only in dev.

---

## Tier 2 — Orchestration primitives (Sprint C)

**Goal:** Ship the user-visible reliability features on top of the now-solid foundation.

| # | Title | Why it's here |
|---|-------|---------------|
| ~~#260~~ ✅ | ~~Persistent task backlog (BACKLOG-001)~~ | **Shipped** in PR #316. SQLite-backed FIFO backlog with `status=queued`. Drain via `BacklogService.try_drain_one()` called on slot release. 24h stale expiry. Depth cap configurable per-agent. |
| ~~#271~~ ✅ | ~~Retry mechanism for scheduled executions~~ | **Shipped** in PR #332. Configurable `max_retries` (0-5, default 1) and `retry_delay_seconds` (30-600, default 60). Rate-limited (429) failures use 2x delay. Retries persist to DB and survive scheduler restart via `_recover_pending_retries()`. New status: `pending_retry`. |
| ~~#294~~ 🚫 | ~~Business task validation (VALIDATE-001)~~ **— CLOSED** | Closed without implementation. Pause rationale held up: a second full Claude session per task is a 2x cost feature that's better subsumed by cheaper in-process primitives (output schemas, post-hoc validators). No new execution machinery shipped. |
| ~~#264~~ ✅ | ~~Self-execute during chat (SELF-EXEC-001)~~ | **Shipped** in PR #334. Detects source==target, sets `X-Self-Task` header, optionally injects result back into chat session via `inject_result` parameter. Uses backlog for overflow when at capacity. |
| ~~#291~~ ✅ | ~~Agent webhook triggers (WEBHOOK-001)~~ | **Shipped** in PR #484 (2026-04-25; follow-up fix PR #493). New `routers/webhooks.py` exposes `POST /api/webhooks/{webhook_token}` (no JWT, rate-limited 10 calls/60s, returns 202). Per-schedule `webhook_token` (43-char `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) lives on `agent_schedules` with partial unique index for O(1) lookup; rotate via `POST .../webhook` (instantly invalidates old URL), revoke via DELETE. Optional `{"context": "..."}` body (≤4000 chars) wrapped in framing header before append to schedule message. All triggers audit-logged with `triggered_by="webhook"`. Funnels through the unified executor — no process-engine reuse. **Deviation from issue spec:** opaque token, not HMAC-signed URL — simpler revocation/rotation story; idempotency deferred to #525. |

### Architectural shift

**Before:** Overflow = 429 hard reject. Retry = none. Validation = none. Scheduler, webhooks, MCP, UI each have subtly different failure modes.

**After:** A single invariant — *every* trigger type (user chat, schedule, webhook, retry, validation, self-execute, fan-out, event subscription) produces the same shape:

```
(trigger) ─► execution record (pending|queued)
             ─► TaskExecutionService
                ├─ slot acquired (or enqueued)
                ├─ traced
                ├─ PID tracked
                ├─ heartbeat monitored
                └─ terminal with preserved error
```

Retry and validation are **not new infrastructure** — they're just new trigger sources that produce more execution records. That's the architectural payoff.

### Considerations

- ✅ **Backlog depth cap**: Shipped with configurable per-agent depth, default 50 (#260).
- ✅ **FIFO only for v1**: Shipped. Priority deferred to v2 (#260).
- ✅ **Stale expiry**: 24h expiry shipped. Maintenance task cleans expired entries (#260).
- ✅ **Retry should enqueue, not dispatch directly**: Shipped — retries create new execution records and flow through the unified executor (#271).
- **Validation session is an agent call to itself**: no new execution machinery needed — it's just a task with an auditor prompt. Keeps the surface small.
- **Multi-worker drain coordination**: `BacklogService.try_drain_one()` uses atomic SQLite UPDATE with `queued_at` ordering. Single-writer model with cleanup service as fallback drainer.

---

## Tier 2.5 — Simplification (Sprint D) — **NEXT**

**Goal:** Collapse the three-queues / nine-cleanup-paths / twelve-status-writers pyramid that has accumulated across Sprints A–C. The pyramid exists because dispatch is HTTP-blocking and agent state is reconciled from three sources (Redis + DB + agent). Fix those two roots and most of the pyramid falls away.

**Premise from the 2026-04-20 review:** Each new Sprint C primitive welds itself into the pyramid; adding #294 / #291 on top first would make consolidation strictly harder. Reorder: simplify before extending.

### Sequencing within Sprint D

```
#306 (push bus) ─► soak ≥2 weeks ─► #428 (CAPACITY-CONSOLIDATE) ─► #429 (CLEANUP-COLLAPSE)
                                 └► #430 (PROCESS-ENGINE-DECISION) (parallel)
```

| # | Title | Why it's here |
|---|-------|---------------|
| ~~#306~~ ✅ | ~~Redis Streams event bus (RELIABILITY-003)~~ — keystone | **Shipped.** `services/event_bus.py` (`EventBus` publisher + `StreamDispatcher` consumer), `XADD`/`XREAD BLOCK`, reconnect replay via `last-event-id` query param (regex-gated, `REPLAY_GAP_LIMIT=5000` → `resync_required`), 3-failure client eviction, MAXLEN-trimmed stream. Frontend tracks `_eid` and handles `resync_required`. `ConnectionManager.broadcast()` now funnels through `XADD`. 2-week soak window before Tier 2.5 consolidation — track push success rate + orphan count. |
| ~~#428~~ ✅ | ~~CAPACITY-CONSOLIDATE~~ | **Shipped (2026-04-26).** New `services/capacity_manager.py` is the single public facade for capacity (`acquire`/`release`/`status`/`reclaim_stale`/`force_release`). Composes `SlotService` (Redis ZSET counter) and `BacklogService` (SQL persistent overflow) as private internals; owns the in-memory overflow store (Redis LIST, depth 3, lifted from the deleted `ExecutionQueue`). `/chat` uses `(max_parallel_tasks, queue_in_memory)`; `/task` uses `(max_parallel_tasks, queue_persistent)`. Single path — no feature flag — per user direction; `dev`-soak + clean revert is the rollback mechanism. `ExecutionQueue` deleted (~360 LOC). 7 caller sites collapsed to one API. 21 new unit tests + 35 watchdog + 33 backlog tests pass. Wire format unchanged (Redis keys, SQL columns) so in-flight executions are unaffected. |
| **NEW** | **#429 (CLEANUP-COLLAPSE)** | Once agent is authoritative for "is this running?" (via push), retire Phase 1/1b/1c/3 reconciliation. Slot TTL disappears — capacity is recomputed from DB, not TTL'd. Target: 9 paths → 1 periodic `DB ⟷ agent./api/running` sync. **Do not ship until #306 has been in prod ≥2 weeks with zero observed orphans.** |
| ~~#430~~ ✅ | ~~Process Engine decision (PROCESS-ENGINE-DECISION)~~ | **Shipped (2026-04-24). Option B — delete.** `services/process_engine/` removed (~8 000 LOC). All PE routers (`processes`, `process_templates`, `executions`, `audit`, `alerts`, `approvals`, `triggers`) deleted. Frontend views/stores/components removed. Dead imports purged from `main.py`. Cost-alerts tab removed from OperatingRoom (was already 404ing). Archive preserved on branch `archive/process-engine`. Every future orchestration invariant now applies universally — no more "except process engine" footnotes. |

### Architectural shift

**Before (today):** Three queue primitives, nine cleanup paths, twelve status writers, seven dispatch sites, HTTP connection held up to 3610s. Each new trigger type (retry, validation, webhook, event sub, self-exec) adds its own reconciliation wrinkle. FAILED→SUCCESS races patched by Phase 3 re-verify.

**After Sprint D:** One `CapacityManager`. Dispatch is a <5s HTTP 202; agent pushes completion via Redis Stream. Backend consumer writes the result once. One reconciliation loop (agent is source of truth). No TTL math. New trigger types add zero new cleanup paths.

### Additive-first migration (regression mitigation)

The watchdog pyramid is load-bearing *right now*. The migration must not trade known bugs for unknown ones:

1. **#306 ships alongside** the existing HTTP path — both active, push is opt-in per agent initially.
2. **#428 (CAPACITY-CONSOLIDATE)** lands behind a feature flag per agent, or class-by-class, with old Queue/Slot/Backlog classes kept until all callers have moved.
3. **#429 (CLEANUP-COLLAPSE) is the riskiest and must not ship early.** Gate it on "#306 in prod ≥2 weeks, zero orphan observations."
4. Every PR must leave the system in a shippable state — no multi-PR in-between states where both old and new paths are partially wired.

Worst case: new paths break and we fall back to existing paths. Old code gets deleted after proof, not before.

### Verification gates before exiting Tier 2.5

- Push completion success rate ≥99.9% over 2 weeks (tracked via stream consumer metrics).
- Zero orphan recoveries from Phase 0 watchdog during soak period.
- Grep for direct `SlotService` / `ExecutionQueue` / `BacklogService` instantiation returns zero hits outside `CapacityManager` and its tests.
- Single writer per `schedule_executions.status` transition, verifiable by audit.
- #408 closeable as a dissolved symptom (no code change on #408 itself).

---

## Tier 2.6 — Reliability hardening (Sprint D′) — **NEW (2026-04-26)**

**Goal:** Close the three architectural gaps that survive even after Sprint D ships. Surfaced from a structural critique (2026-04-26): the unified funnel, push transport, and consolidated capacity manager fix the *plumbing*, but leave three contract-level holes — split state authority, no producer idempotency, and no producer-side health gating. These don't dissolve out of #428/#429; they need their own work.

### Sequencing within Sprint D′

```
#524 (state machine contract) ─► prerequisite to #429 deletion of cleanup phases
                              ─► enables single-writer guarantee by construction
#525 (idempotency keys)         parallel — independent of state machine
                              ─► most acute for webhooks (#291) and scheduler dispatch
#526 (dispatch circuit breaker) consumes #307 heartbeat (Tier 3) when available
                              ─► can ship with failure-rate detection alone first
```

| # | Title | Why it's here |
|---|-------|---------------|
| ~~#524~~ ✅ | ~~Agent-authoritative execution state machine (RELIABILITY-005)~~ | **Shipped (minimal scope, 2026-04-27).** Full projector architecture deferred — too risky without proper restart-recovery and transport design (agents have no Redis access). Shipped instead: (1) CAS guard in `update_execution_status` — SUCCESS always wins, non-success terminal writes blocked if row already terminal; (2) TOCTOU fix in `mark_stale_executions_failed` / `mark_no_session_executions_failed` — inner UPDATE now carries `AND status = 'running'`; (3) `_recover_execution` routed through already-guarded `mark_execution_failed_by_watchdog`; (4) state machine documented in `TaskExecutionStatus` docstring + `PENDING_RETRY` added to enum. Full projector (`ExecutionStateProjector`, agent event emission, `projected_status` shadow column) remains as future work before #429 can retire cleanup phases. |
| **#525** | **Idempotency keys at trigger boundaries (RELIABILITY-006)** | `Idempotency-Key` header on every producer (chat, task, internal/scheduler, webhooks #291, MCP, event-sub, self-exec). Backend stores `(key → execution_id)` for 24h and short-circuits duplicates. Webhook trigger auto-derives a key from `(token, body_hash)` for naive senders. Scheduler uses `(schedule_id, fire_time)`. **The unified funnel makes duplicates more uniform — this is the missing dedup layer.** |
| **#526** | **Per-agent dispatch circuit breaker (RELIABILITY-007)** | Producer-side breaker in front of `SlotService` / `BacklogService`. Opens on rolling failure rate; fast-fails 503 instead of enqueuing into a doomed backlog. Drains existing backlog on trip with `circuit_open` reason. Distinct from #304 (closed — agent-to-agent) and #307 (heartbeat *signal*); this is the **consumer** of that signal. |

### Architectural shift

**Before Sprint D′:** Status column has ~12 writers patched by Phase 3 re-verify. Webhook re-deliveries and scheduler-to-backend network blips silently produce duplicate executions. Agent with expired auth keeps draining slots and queuing 50 doomed tasks until somebody notices.

**After Sprint D′:** Agent emits canonical state events; backend has one projector that is the only `status` writer. Every trigger boundary accepts `Idempotency-Key`; duplicates short-circuit. Unhealthy agent trips a breaker within seconds and starts fast-failing 503; backlog is never poisoned.

### Verification gates before exiting Tier 2.6

- Invariant test asserts no execution has a FAILED→SUCCESS or double-terminal transition in `audit_log` over a 30-day window.
- Idempotent replay rate observable in logs/metrics; webhook duplicate-storm test (10 retries within 1 s) produces exactly one execution.
- Forced failure injection (revoke an agent's API key) → circuit opens within 60 s and existing backlog drains with `circuit_open` failures, not 24-hour timeouts.

---

## Tier 3 — Remaining push telemetry (Sprint E)

**Goal:** Finish the polling-to-push migration that #306 started.

| # | Title | Why it's here |
|---|-------|---------------|
| #307 | Agent heartbeat push (RELIABILITY-004) | Flip 30s polling (`monitoring_service.py:654`) → 5s push. Feeds monitoring + (future) circuit breaker. Uses the Redis stream established in #306. |

### Considerations

- **Redis memory**: stream trim via `MAXLEN ~10000`. Without this, a burst of activity blows up Redis.
- **Backward compat**: WebSocket event shape must not change. Frontend needs `lastEventId` support but old events should still render.

## Tier 4 — Scale (Sprint F, later)

| # | Title |
|---|-------|
| #24 | Horizontal agent scalability (pools + load balancing) |
| #18 | Unified Executions Dashboard (EXEC-022) |

### Why last

- Horizontal scaling only pays off after backlog (Tier 2) is the scheduling authority and heartbeat (Tier 3) tells the router which instances are live. Otherwise scaling multiplies broken parts.
- Unified dashboard is low engineering risk but benefits from Redis Streams (#306) for live updates and consistent execution records (Tier 0) for meaningful aggregation.

---

## Already shipped (do not re-plan)

- **EVT-001** (#169, closed) — `routers/event_subscriptions.py`, SQLite-backed pub/sub, permission-gated, template interpolation.
- **Fan-out** (#230, closed) — `services/fan_out_service.py` + `routers/fan_out.py`, barrier-wait, per-task status.
- **Cleanup watchdog** (#129/#94, closed) — active reconciliation + passive stale recovery in `cleanup_service.py`.
- **Event Bus #22** (closed) — subsumed by EVT-001 SQLite path; upgrade to Redis Streams covered by #306.
- **Agent process termination** — `docker/base-image/agent_server/services/process_registry.py` already implements SIGINT→SIGKILL with wait. #61 wires backend cleanup into this existing endpoint, not new infrastructure.
- **Scheduler async dispatch (`SCHED-ASYNC-001`)** — `src/scheduler/service.py:823` already does fire-and-forget + DB polling. #132 is a tuning task on top of this, not a rewrite.

### Out of scope (intentionally separate)

- **Process Engine** has its own execution surface: `process_engine/engine/handlers/agent_task.py` calls `AgentClient.chat()` directly, bypassing `TaskExecutionService`, slot service, and cleanup service. It is intentionally outside this consolidation. Slot/timeout/PID work in Tier 0 does not apply to process steps. *Known limitation:* a process kicking off many parallel `agent_task` steps will not respect agent capacity. **File a tracking issue** (suggested title: "Process Engine `agent_task` should funnel through TaskExecutionService") so this surfaces in grooming rather than rotting inside this doc.

## Future considerations (not yet ranked, surfaced 2026-04-26)

These are real architectural gaps surfaced by the same critique that produced Tier 2.6. They're recorded here so they don't rot — promote to issues when the symptoms warrant or when Sprint D′ exits and we have head-room. Roughly ordered by leverage.

1. **Persist agent-side `ProcessRegistry` across restarts.** Today it's pure in-memory. A container crash loses PIDs, log buffer, and `/last-error` source — exactly when an operator most needs them. Write-through to a small SQLite file in the container, or have the agent re-emit "I'm running these IDs" on startup. ~100-line change, outsized recovery value. (Largely subsumed by #524 if the projector mirrors agent state durably; revisit after #524 lands.)

2. **Move retry into `TaskExecutionService`, classified by `error_code`.** Today only the scheduler retries (#271). Webhook, MCP, chat, fan-out, event-sub do not. The funnel already knows the typed `error_code`; only `NETWORK` and rate-limit `CAPACITY` should auto-retry. Producers should not have retry policies at all. *Pairs with #525 (idempotency) — retries inside the funnel must not duplicate.*

3. **Synchronous ack on terminate, with escalation.** Today: SIGINT, 5 s wait, hope. Replace with: backend SIGINT → agent confirms receipt → agent confirms process-group reaped → backend marks terminated. Bounded budget (~10 s) before escalating to container restart, instead of waiting up to 5 min for cleanup to notice.

4. **Two streams, not one.** Split `trinity:events` into `trinity:ui-events` (lossy, MAXLEN-trimmed, live UI fan-out) and `trinity:audit-events` (durable, never trimmed, persisted to `audit_log`). Today slow WS clients can cause audit data to disappear silently because both share `MAXLEN ~10000`. The transports have different reliability requirements; treating them as one quietly costs observability.

5. **Fairness primitive in `CapacityManager` (#428).** When the three queues collapse, don't ship pure FIFO — add per-user / per-subscription token buckets so one tenant can't saturate a shared agent. Hard to retrofit later; cheap to design in while #428 is live work.

6. **Producer-side backpressure on `EventBus`.** Today `XADD` never blocks producers; under sustained pressure, `MAXLEN ~10000` silently trims and slow clients are evicted. No producer flow control. Consider bounded-blocking publish or a separate audit lane (overlaps with #4 above).

7. **A single "execution lifecycle" contract document.** One page: states, allowed transitions, who's authorized to write each one, what events get emitted. The implicit-across-files version is exactly why the system grew 12 status writers nobody could name. (Becomes maintenance work after #524 lands — write the contract document while building it.)

These are recommendations, not commitments. Re-read this list at each sprint planning checkpoint.

HTTP sync chat   ─► routers/chat.py
HTTP async task  ─► routers/chat.py ─► _execute_task_background()  ◄── duplicate path

### After Tier 0 + 1 (CURRENT — April 2026)

```
All entry paths ─► TaskExecutionService (single path)

Recovery:  ONE periodic sync (DB ⟷ agent./api/running; agent wins).
Writers to schedule_executions.status:  ~4 (create, start, finish, external-cancel).
No TTL math. No multi-phase cleanup pyramid. FAILED→SUCCESS race impossible
(single-writer event consumer owns the terminal transition).
```

### After Tier 2 (partial — #260, #271, #264 shipped)

```
request at capacity ─► try slot.acquire()
                        ├─ success → execute
                        ├─ slot full → backlog.enqueue() → 202 queued  ✅ #260
                        └─ backlog full → 429

slot.release_slot() ── try_drain_one() ──► BacklogService
                                           ├─ atomic claim (UPDATE with queued_at order)
                                           └─ TaskExecutionService.execute_task_async()

Scheduler failure ─► _maybe_schedule_retry()  ✅ #271
                     ├─ check max_retries, attempt_number
                     ├─ calculate delay (2x for 429)
                     ├─ persist retry_scheduled_at to DB
                     └─ APScheduler DateTrigger → _execute_retry()

New triggers, all funnel into the same executor:
  • Webhook         ─► schedule dispatch (token-in-URL, rate-limited)  ✅ #291
  • Self-execute    ─► X-Self-Task, optional inject_result        ✅ #264
  • Retry           ─► new execution with retry_of_execution_id   ✅ #271
  • Validation      ─► auditor session, writes business_status    [#294 pending]
  • Event sub       ─► (already funnels)
  • Fan-out         ─► (already funnels)
```

## What to do next on the board

1. ~~Add `blocked-by` links: #260 ← #95, #271 ← #285, #294 ← #95.~~ All shipped.
2. ~~Bump #95 to `status-ready` with a "do this first, alone" note.~~ ✅ Shipped.
3. ~~Merge-candidate tag on #226 + #61~~ — Both shipped (PRs #323, #326).
4. ~~Merge-candidate tag on #305 + #286~~ — Both shipped (PRs #324, #330).
5. ~~Confirm scope cuts for #260: FIFO-only v1, depth 50 default, 24h expiry.~~ ✅ Shipped with these cuts in PR #316.
6. ~~Rescope #132 against `src/scheduler/service.py`~~ — ✅ Shipped in PR #328.
7. ~~Re-estimate #56~~ — ✅ Shipped in PR #329.
8. ~~Decide #291 direction~~ — ✅ **Shipped (PR #484, 2026-04-25).** Token-in-URL trigger funnels through `TaskExecutionService`. Idempotency layer deferred to #525.
9. ~~**Next:** Pick up #294 (validation).~~ — **Closed without implementation.**
10. ~~**Next (2026-04-20):** Pick up **#306**~~ — ✅ **Shipped.** Soak window started on merge date; track push success rate + orphan count.
11. ~~**Follow-up:** Create and rank the three new issues from Tier 2.5~~ — Issues #428, #429, #430 exist; rank + tier assignment tracked in the Roadmap project board (groomed 2026-04-22).
12. ~~**Next (current):** Pick up **#428 (CAPACITY-CONSOLIDATE)** once #306 has ≥2 weeks of clean soak (zero orphan recoveries, push success ≥99.9%). In parallel, pick up **#430 (PROCESS-ENGINE-DECISION)** — no soak dependency, unblocks #291.~~ ✅ **#430 shipped (2026-04-24)**, ✅ **#291 shipped (PR #484, 2026-04-25)**, ✅ **#428 shipped (2026-04-26).** **Soak deviation:** user explicitly accepted shipping #428 after only 5 days of #306 soak rather than the planned 2 weeks; mitigated by additive-style refactor (Redis keys + SQL columns unchanged), `dev`-soak before `main`, and clean revert path.
13. **Re-evaluate #408** — #306 is live, so the predicted dissolution condition now holds. Verify no long-running HTTP call remains in `TaskExecutionService` and close as dissolved (no direct code change needed).
14. **Then:** #429 (CLEANUP-COLLAPSE) gated on #428 landing + continued clean soak — the riskiest step per §"Additive-first migration."
15. **New (2026-04-26): Tier 2.6 hardening** — pick up **#524 (state machine contract)** as prerequisite to actually deleting cleanup phases in #429; **#525 (idempotency keys)** in parallel (most acute for webhooks #291); **#526 (dispatch circuit breaker)** parallel, sharpens further when #307 heartbeat ships. See *Tier 2.6 — Reliability hardening* and *Future considerations* sections.
16. **New (2026-04-26): Phase 2 actor-model experiment (parallel to Sprint D′).** First write the pre-experiment postcard (message envelope + journal format). If it fits cleanly, scope and run the smallest test — convert MCP `chat_with_agent` (agent→agent only) to message-passing through `BacklogService`. See *Target architecture: actor model* for the full transition roadmap and decision gate.
