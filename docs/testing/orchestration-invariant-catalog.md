# Trinity Orchestration Invariant Catalog

> **Purpose**: Catalog of system invariants that must hold across Trinity's orchestration layer, and the design approach for a continuous canary harness that verifies them on staging/dev.
>
> **Status**: Proposal — pending research & implementation (see tracking issue).

## Motivation

Trinity has accumulated a class of orchestration bugs that unit tests don't catch:

- **PR #378/#403** — *phantom stale-slot failures*: cleanup service's Phase 3 marked executions FAILED based on a stale Phase 0 snapshot, then the real SUCCESS arrived and overwrote it. User saw a failure flash that wasn't real.
- **PR #407/#410** — *subprocess reaping*: Claude subprocess children kept stdout pipes open; reader thread hung forever; agent-server spun at 83% CPU until container restart.
- **Issue #129** — *orphaned executions*: DB rows stuck in `running` because the agent completed the task but never reported back. No passive cleanup caught this.
- **Issue #219/#226** — *slot TTL vs. execution timeout mismatch*: slots expired while legitimate long tasks were still running.

Each of these violated a property that was *obvious in hindsight*:
- "A terminal execution state must be immutable."
- "Every subprocess must be reapable on every exit path."
- "Every `running` execution must map to either an agent registry entry or a cleanup action within one cycle."
- "Slot TTL must be ≥ execution timeout."

These are **invariants** — properties that must *always* hold. When written down, they become testable, and a continuous test harness can verify them 24/7 against a live staging instance.

This document catalogs those invariants and proposes the harness that tests them.

---

## Framework

Testing orchestration systematically rests on five ideas, in order of leverage:

### 1. Invariants-first, not assertions-first
Before writing any test code, write the catalog. Invariants are properties of the *system state*, not properties of *one flow's outcome*. A test suite built on assertions catches known bugs; one built on invariants catches structural drift.

### 2. Black-box canary harness
A pytest suite running against the staging API as an ordinary user: create agent → schedule → trigger → observe → assert invariants from DB + Vector logs. Treats Trinity as a box. Runs on cron or as a scheduled Trinity agent. Cheap, catches ~80% of real issues.

### 3. Property-based scenario generation (Hypothesis stateful)
Model the agent lifecycle as a state machine (idle/queued/running/completed/failed + slot + backlog state). Hypothesis generates random valid command sequences — finds the weird interleavings humans never write by hand. Best fit for orchestration bugs.

### 4. Chaos layer (opt-in)
Pumba/toxiproxy to kill agent containers mid-run, drop Redis connections, slow the Docker socket. The gate: does cleanup reconcile? do slots release? does reaping hold? This is where #407-class bugs hide.

### 5. Load/concurrency harness
k6 or Locust driving parallel chat + schedule triggers — exposes slot leaks, race conditions in the queue.

**Design principle**: treat staging as a permanent tenant of a "chaos-canary" system — synthetic fleet, synthetic workloads, real infra. The goal isn't pass/fail on a feature, it's **proving invariants hold under adversarial conditions 24/7**.

## Invariant tiering

Invariants are grouped by subsystem. Each entry has a **tier** and **severity**:

- **Tier A (always)** — must hold at every observable instant. Violation = bug.
- **Tier B (eventually ≤ T)** — must reconcile within SLA T (driven by cleanup cycles). Violation beyond T = bug.
- **Severity**:
  - 🔴 **critical** — corruption, loss, or stuck state
  - 🟡 **major** — user-visible wrong state
  - 🟢 **minor** — drift, eventual self-healing

Each invariant is expressed so it is directly checkable — as a SQL predicate, Redis query, or Docker state diff. "Signal" is the exact query the canary harness runs.

---

## 1. Execution lifecycle (`schedule_executions`)

State machine: `queued → running → {success, failed, cancelled}`. See `src/backend/services/task_execution_service.py:288-598`, `src/backend/models.py:TaskExecutionStatus`.

**E-01** Terminal-state closure *(Tier B ≤ timeout + 5 min, 🔴)*
Every execution reaches a terminal state within its timeout + slot buffer.
Signal: `status='running' AND started_at < now() - (timeout_seconds + 300s)` → must be 0.

**E-02** No phantom reversal *(Tier A, 🔴)* — the #378/#403 invariant.
Once an execution is in a terminal state, its `status` is immutable for the rest of its life.
Signal: audit-log every status transition; any `{success|failed|cancelled} → *` after that = violation.

**E-03** Completed rows are fully populated *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`status IN (success, failed, cancelled)` ⇒ `completed_at IS NOT NULL AND duration_ms IS NOT NULL`.
Signal: `status IN (...) AND (completed_at IS NULL OR duration_ms IS NULL)` → 0.

**E-04** Queued rows have metadata *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`status='queued'` ⇒ `queued_at IS NOT NULL AND backlog_metadata IS NOT NULL AND json_valid(backlog_metadata)`.
(Protects `backlog_service.drain_next` against `json.JSONDecodeError`.)

**E-05** Dispatched rows have session *(Tier B ≤ 60 s, 🟡)* — Issue #106 guard.
`status='running' AND started_at < now() - 60s` ⇒ `claude_session_id IS NOT NULL` (even just `'dispatched'`). If not, `mark_no_session_executions_failed` should have fired.

**E-06** No stuck "completed-on-agent-but-not-reported" *(Tier B ≤ 5 min, 🔴)* — Issue #129 invariant.
For every `status='running'` row with `started_at < now() - 60s`, the agent's `/api/executions/running` must report the `execution_id`. If not, watchdog must mark it failed within one cycle.
Signal: cross-check DB × agent registry; violations older than one cycle are true orphans.

**E-07** Retry chain integrity *(Tier A, 🟢)*
`retry_of_execution_id IS NOT NULL` ⇒ referenced row exists and has same `agent_name` and `schedule_id`.

**E-08** Cancellation is sticky *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Once `status='cancelled'`, no service writes a different terminal state (see `task_execution_service.py:498, 548`). Check: watchdog's `mark_execution_failed_by_watchdog` refuses to overwrite `cancelled`.

---

## 2. Slots ↔ executions (`slot_service.py` / Redis ZSET)

**S-01** Slot–row bijection *(Tier A, 🟠 — downgraded 🔴→🟠 major by #1082: redundant under single-owner status, retires with the slot ZSET in #1081 Phase 5)* — THE core orchestration invariant.
For every agent A: `ZMEMBERS(agent:slots:A)` = `{row.id for row in schedule_executions where agent_name=A and status='running'}` ∪ `{sentinel drain tokens < ~5s old}`.
Signal: symmetric diff of both sets. Drift here = the #219/#226/#378 class of bugs.

**S-02** No overbooking *(Tier A, 🔴)*
`ZCARD(agent:slots:A) ≤ agent_ownership.max_parallel_tasks` at all times. Violation ⇒ `acquire_slot` bypass.

**S-03** Slot TTL ≥ execution timeout *(Tier A, 🔴)* — TIMEOUT-001/#226.
For every member of `agent:slots:A`, the companion `agent:slot:A:{eid}` HASH has `TTL ≥ timeout_seconds + SLOT_TTL_BUFFER(300)`.
Signal: `redis TTL agent:slot:A:{eid}` < `timeout_seconds` ⇒ premature-expiry bug.

**S-04** Metadata–membership consistency *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`eid ∈ ZSET(agent:slots:A)` ⇔ `EXISTS agent:slot:A:{eid}` HASH.
Signal: asymmetric presence ⇒ `acquire`/`release` path forgot a step.

**S-05** Release is idempotent and ordered *(Tier A, 🔴)*
After `release_slot(A, eid)`: (a) `eid ∉ ZSET(agent:slots:A)`, (b) `agent:slot:A:{eid}` deleted, (c) execution row is in terminal state.
Signal: released-but-row-still-running triples ⇒ slot leak.

**S-06** No slot resurrection *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Once a slot is released for `eid`, no subsequent `ZADD agent:slots:A eid` should ever occur (ids are single-use).
Signal: audit slot ops; duplicate `ZADD` with same `eid` ⇒ bug.

**S-07** Sentinel lifetime bounded *(Tier A, 🟢)* — BACKLOG-001 drain.
Any `drain-{agent}-{ts}` sentinel in a slots ZSET lives < 10 s. (The drain in `backlog_service.py:158-189` holds it only briefly.) Stale sentinels ⇒ drain crash mid-claim.

---

## 3. Backlog ↔ queued executions (`backlog_service.py`)

**B-01** Queue-status coherence *(Tier A, 🔴)*
`backlog_service.get_queued_count(A) = COUNT(schedule_executions WHERE agent_name=A AND status='queued')`. Backlog never has its own table — queued rows ARE the queue.

**B-02** No queued without slots-full *(Tier B ≤ 60 s, 🔴)*
If `COUNT(status='queued' AND agent_name=A) > 0`, then either (a) `ZCARD(agent:slots:A) = max_parallel_tasks` or (b) a drain callback/maintenance tick is pending (≤60 s SLA).
Signal: queued rows while slots have free space ⇒ drain callback failed. `drain_orphans_all` is the backstop every 60 s.

**B-03** Claim atomicity *(Tier A, 🔴)*
At most one drain wins for a given queued row (enforced by single-row `UPDATE … RETURNING` in `claim_next_queued`). Check: count of transitions `queued → running` per execution_id = exactly 1.

**B-04** Claim-release pairing *(Tier A, 🔴)*
If `claim_next_queued` returns a row but the subsequent real `acquire_slot` fails, `release_claim_to_queued` must flip status back to `queued` (see `backlog_service.py:196-199`). Signal: rows stuck in non-`queued`, non-terminal state with no active slot.

**B-05** Stale expiry *(Tier B ≤ 60 s + 24 h, 🟢)*
`status='queued' AND queued_at < now() - 24h` ⇒ gets FAILED by `expire_stale_queued` within 60 s.

**B-06** Backlog cap honored *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`COUNT(queued WHERE agent_name=A) ≤ max_backlog_depth(A)` at time of enqueue. Race exists; treat as Tier B ≤ next drain if briefly violated.

**B-07** Agent deletion drains backlog *(Tier A on delete, 🔴)*
After agent delete, `COUNT(status='queued' AND agent_name=A) = 0` (cancelled with reason). See `backlog_service.cancel_all_backlog`.

---

## 4. Activities ↔ executions ↔ chat

**AC-01** Every execution has a start activity *(Tier B ≤ 5 s, 🟡)*
For every `schedule_executions` row, there exists an `agent_activities` row with `related_execution_id = <row.id> AND activity_type IN (chat_start, schedule_start) AND activity_state = 'started'` within 5 s of creation.

**AC-02** Activity terminal mirrors execution terminal *(Tier A on update, 🟡)*
If activity `related_execution_id = X` and execution X has terminal state, the activity is `completed` or `failed` (not `started`).
Signal: activities in `'started'` whose linked execution is terminal > 1 min old ⇒ bug in `complete_activity` path.

**AC-03** No stale started activities *(Tier B ≤ 120 min, 🟢)*
`activity_state='started' AND started_at < now() - 120min` ⇒ `mark_stale_activities_failed` ran.

**AC-04** Parent activity lifetime ≥ child lifetime *(Tier A, 🟢)*
If `child.parent_activity_id = P`, then `parent.started_at ≤ child.started_at` and parent only closes after all children closed (or closes with `failed`).

**AC-05** Chat session aggregates consistent *(Tier B ≤ next message, 🟢)*
`chat_sessions.message_count = COUNT(chat_messages WHERE session_id=X)` and `total_cost = SUM(cost)`.

**AC-06** One active session per (agent, user) *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`COUNT(chat_sessions WHERE agent_name=A AND user_id=U AND status='active') ≤ 1`.

**AC-07** Chat message → session FK intact *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Every `chat_messages.session_id` resolves to a `chat_sessions.id` (same `agent_name`, `user_id`). Never orphaned after agent delete — deletion must cascade.

---

## 5. Agent lifecycle (Docker ↔ DB)

**L-01** DB row ⇔ container presence *(Tier A post-op, 🔴)*
For every `agent_ownership` row, exactly 0 or 1 Docker containers labeled `trinity.platform=agent, trinity.agent-name=<name>` exist (0 = stopped, 1 = any running/stopped state). And: every Trinity-labeled container has a matching row.
Signal: left/right join between `agent_ownership` and `docker ps -a --filter label=trinity.platform=agent`.

**L-02** Create is atomic *(Tier A, 🔴)*
After a create request, either (row AND container) both exist, or neither does. No dangling container, no dangling DB row.
Test: kill backend mid-create; after restart, reconcile finds neither.

**L-03** Delete cascades *(Tier A post-delete, 🔴)*
After `DELETE /api/agents/{name}`, ALL these are 0: rows in `agent_ownership`, `agent_sharing`, `agent_schedules`, `schedule_executions (non-terminal)`, `agent_permissions` (as source OR target), `agent_event_subscriptions` (as subscriber OR source), `mcp_api_keys (scope='agent')`, `slack_channel_agents`, `agent_shared_folder_config`, `chat_sessions (status='active')`, and Redis `agent:slots:{name}` + metadata keys.

**L-04** No orphan container outlives DB row *(Tier B ≤ 60 s, 🔴)*
Container exists without `agent_ownership` row ⇒ cleanup stops/removes it.

**L-05** Running container ⇒ agent-server responsive *(Tier B ≤ 30 s of start, 🟡)*
Container `status='running'` ⇒ `GET http://agent-{name}:8000/api/health` returns 200 within 30 s.

**L-06** Credential injection precedes first chat *(Tier A, 🟡)*
Any successful `POST /api/task` on agent A implies `.env` (or `.credentials.enc` auto-import) has been materialized. Signal: task rejection if `credentials-status='missing'` on cold start.

---

## 6. Agent-runtime subprocess hygiene (PR #407)

**R-01** No zombie Claude processes *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Inside every running agent container: `ps -eo stat,comm | grep ' Z.*claude' | wc -l = 0`.

**R-02** No orphan process groups *(Tier B ≤ 10 s post-exit, 🔴)*
When agent registry shows `/api/executions/running = []`, no process in the container has a pgid matching any recently-tracked execution. (The #407 invariant: subprocess pgroup must be reaped.)

**R-03** Pipe FDs closed *(Tier B ≤ 10 s, 🟡)*
No pipe FDs remain open to a completed claude process. Proxy signal: agent-server `RSS` and `FD count` return to baseline within 10 s of execution completion.

**R-04** CPU baseline *(Tier B ≤ 10 s, 🟡)*
Idle agent (no running executions) shows `agent-server` CPU < 5 %. (Was 83 % with reader thread stuck pre-#407.)

---

## 7. Permissions, sharing, access control

**P-01** Permission edge FK integrity *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Every row in `agent_permissions` points to two existing agents. Dangling edges = cascade bug in delete.

**P-02** MCP-layer enforcement matches DB *(Tier A, 🟡)*
Agent A's MCP `list_agents` returns exactly `{A} ∪ {B : exists agent_permissions(A→B)}`. Agent A's `chat_with_agent(B)` succeeds iff edge exists or A is system.

**P-03** Sharing → access symmetry *(Tier A, 🟡)*
User U can chat via web/Slack/Telegram with A iff one of: U is owner, U is admin, `agent_sharing(A, U.email)` exists, or `open_access(A)=1 AND U.email verified`.

**P-04** Access request closes cleanly *(Tier A on decide, 🟢)*
Approving `access_requests(A, email)` inserts `agent_sharing(A, email)` in the same transaction and flips status to `approved`.

**P-05** First-login role respects whitelist *(Tier A, 🟡)* — #314.
New email user's `users.role` = `email_whitelist.default_role` for their email, or `'user'` if no row. Never silently promoted to `creator`.

---

## 8. Schedules

**SCH-01** Schedule → executions linkage *(Tier A, 🟢)*
Every `schedule_executions.schedule_id` (when non-null) resolves to a live `agent_schedules.id`. Schedule delete ⇒ associated non-terminal executions are cancelled; historical terminal rows are either preserved with null FK or kept for history (pick one — today's answer: preserved).

**SCH-02** `last_run_at` ≤ max(completed_at) *(Tier B ≤ 5 s, 🟢)*
`agent_schedules.last_run_at` equals `MAX(schedule_executions.completed_at WHERE schedule_id=X)`.

**SCH-03** Next-run sanity *(Tier A, 🟡)*
Every `enabled=1` schedule has `next_run_at IS NOT NULL AND next_run_at > now() - 1min`. (Past by >1 min ⇒ scheduler stuck.)

**SCH-04** Disabled schedule ⇒ no new queued rows *(Tier B ≤ 1 cron-tick, 🟡)*
After `enabled=0`, no new `schedule_executions` rows created beyond the currently-running one.

**SCH-05** Autonomy toggle is all-or-nothing *(Tier A, 🟢)*
`PUT /agents/{name}/autonomy` flips every schedule atomically — partial state violates the user contract.

---

## 9. Operator queue (`OPS-001`)

**OQ-01** Agent-file ↔ DB coherence *(Tier B ≤ 10 s, 🟡)*
Every pending item in `~/.trinity/operator-queue.json` appears in DB within 2 sync cycles (≤10 s). Every `status='responded'` DB row is written back to the agent file within the same window.

**OQ-02** Monotonic state progression *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`pending → responded → acknowledged` (or `pending → cancelled|expired`). No transition out of terminal.

**OQ-03** Expiry freedom *(Tier B ≤ expires_at + 60 s, 🟢)*
`status='pending' AND expires_at < now()` ⇒ marked `expired` within 60 s.

**OQ-04** Responder is authorized *(Tier A, 🔴)*
`responded_by_id` refers to a user with access to the agent at the time of response.

---

## 10. Channel adapters (Slack / Telegram)

**CH-01** Verified email is a stable principal *(Tier A, 🔴)* — #311.
Every channel message reaching `message_router` carries a verified email (or is classified as anonymous and rejected). Signal: `normalized_message.verified_email IS NULL AND adapter ≠ 'public_link' ⇒ rejection`.

**CH-02** Thread → agent binding is stable *(Tier A, 🟡)*
Once a Slack thread is bound to agent A, all subsequent messages in that thread route to A unless the binding is explicitly changed. Agent deletion ⇒ binding row deleted; new messages return a clear rejection (not 500).

**CH-03** Adapter never calls a non-running agent *(Tier A, 🟡)*
`message_router` checks container state before dispatch. A routed task never hits a stopped/missing container.

**CH-04** Rate limiter bounds enforced *(Tier A, 🟢)*
Per-email, per-agent rate limits from `message_router` are the single gate; bypass paths (e.g. group chats) are explicitly documented.

---

## 11. Event subscriptions (EVT-001)

**EV-01** Subscription FK integrity *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Every `agent_event_subscriptions` row has both `source_agent` and `subscriber_agent` existing. Deletion cascades both ways.

**EV-02** Emit → fan-out exactly once *(Tier A, 🟢)*
`emit_event` produces exactly one entry in `agent_events` and triggers exactly N executions where N = `COUNT(enabled subscriptions matching source+type)`. `subscriptions_triggered` field = N.

**EV-03** Subscriber permission or self-own *(Tier A, 🟡)*
If subscription crosses owners, permission edge must exist from subscriber → source (same as chat gating).

---

## 12. MCP keys & cross-surface sync

**MCP-01** Exactly one active agent-scoped key per agent *(Tier A, 🔴)*
`COUNT(mcp_api_keys WHERE agent_name=A AND scope='agent' AND is_active=1) = 1` for every live agent.

**MCP-02** Key-agent deletion symmetry *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Agent delete ⇒ agent-scoped keys deleted. Agent-scoped key cannot be independently revoked (only user-scoped can).

**MCP-03** Three-surface sync — backend/MCP/agent-server *(Tier A, 🟡)* — architectural invariant #13.
For every MCP tool that proxies a backend endpoint, the route exists on both. Drift test: MCP tool list ∪ backend router diff should be empty against a known manifest.

---

## 13. Audit log (SEC-001)

**AU-01** Append-only enforced *(Tier A, 🔴)*
`UPDATE audit_log` returns an error; `DELETE` on rows `< 365 days` returns an error. (SQLite triggers — verify they're installed on every startup.)

**AU-02** Lifecycle events emitted *(Tier A, 🟡)* — Phase 2a.
Every agent create/delete produces an `audit_log` row with matching `target_id` and `event_type='agent_lifecycle'`. Signal: count parity between domain events and audit rows per hour.

---

## 14. Global / cross-cutting

**G-01** No resource leak on restart *(Tier B ≤ startup + 5 min, 🔴)*
After backend restart, cleanup-service startup sweep + `recover_orphaned_executions` leaves no `status='running'` executions without matching agent registry entries. (Violation = stuck-forever states across restart — a real-world class of bug.)

**G-02** Cleanup cycle completes within SLA *(Tier A, 🟡)*
Every cleanup cycle completes within `poll_interval - 30s` (270 s). Exceeding = unresponsive agent starving watchdog → cascading invariant failures. Signal: `last_run_at - previous_last_run_at > 330s`.

**G-03** Clock monotonicity on ordering fields *(Tier A, 🟢)*
`created_at ≤ started_at ≤ completed_at` on every row where all three exist. Protects against clock-drift / mis-assignment bugs.

**G-04** No credential leakage into backlog / logs *(Tier A, 🔴)* — BACKLOG-001 comment.
`backlog_metadata` never contains raw credential values. Grep sampled rows for common patterns (`sk-`, `ghp_`, `xoxb-`); zero matches.

**G-05** Watchdog idempotence *(Tier A, 🔴)*
Running cleanup twice back-to-back produces an empty second report. Failure here ⇒ oscillation / double-failing bug.

---

## Design notes

- **Every Tier-A invariant is a single SQL/Redis query** — make the canary compute it continuously. Tier-B invariants run every SLA window.
- **S-01, E-02, E-06, L-03, G-01 are the five "must never break" invariants** — these encode the fixes from #378/#403/#407/#129 and agent-delete cascades. Put them in a red-alert dashboard.
- **Invariants with Redis ↔ SQLite ↔ Docker triplets** (S-01, L-01, L-03, G-01) are the highest-leverage targets for chaos testing — they fail under partition/crash, not under ordinary load.
- **Audit log** (AU-01/02) gives you retroactive reasoning when a live invariant fires — without it, a Tier-A violation has no forensic trail.
- **Gaps to fill next**: chat-session cascade on user-delete (no such path today); soft-delete vs hard-delete of shared-with-me agents; per-subscription quota invariants (SUB-004 path); fan-out (`fan_out_id`) completion aggregation.

## Recommended starting subset

Twelve invariants cover ~80% of orchestration risk:

| ID | Invariant | Why |
|----|-----------|-----|
| S-01 | Slot–row bijection | Core orchestration consistency |
| S-02 | No overbooking | Capacity guarantee |
| S-03 | Slot TTL ≥ execution timeout | #226 |
| E-01 | Terminal-state closure | No stuck executions |
| E-02 | No phantom reversal | #378/#403 |
| E-05 | Dispatched rows have session | #106 |
| E-06 | No completed-but-not-reported | #129 |
| B-01 | Queue-status coherence | Backlog integrity |
| B-02 | No queued without slots-full | Drain liveness |
| L-03 | Delete cascades | Prevents dangling references |
| G-01 | No resource leak on restart | Recovery correctness |
| R-01 | No zombie Claude processes | #407 |

Start here. Expand as the harness stabilizes.

## Harness design (proposal)

### Topology
- **Staging Trinity instance** — dedicated, isolated. Synthetic fleet of 3–5 agents (pre-seeded templates).
- **Canary agent** — a Trinity agent running on the same instance, scheduled every 5–15 minutes, holding the test scripts.
- **Read-only observer** — queries DB (via backend API or direct SQLite read), Redis (via a bastion MCP tool), Docker (via labels), Vector logs. Asserts invariants. Reports violations.

### Layers (bottom-up)
1. **Invariant library** — each invariant is a pure function `(state_snapshot) → ViolationReport`. Snapshots include: SQL result sets, Redis key dumps, agent registry calls, Docker `ps`.
2. **Snapshot collector** — single function that captures all sources at roughly the same instant and returns a typed snapshot.
3. **Scenario runner** — pytest-style tests that perform actions (create agent, trigger task, delete agent, kill container) and assert invariants after each step.
4. **Continuous canary** — runs the read-only invariant subset every N minutes. Writes violations to a `canary_violations` table + Slack/Telegram alert.
5. **Chaos layer** — opt-in, label-gated. Introduces failure (container kill, Redis disconnect, Docker socket lag) and asserts that Tier-B invariants re-converge within SLA.

### Reporting
- Violations emit a structured event: `{invariant_id, tier, severity, signal_query, observed_state, snapshot_time}`.
- Dashboard: green/red per invariant ID, time-series of violations.
- Trend alerts: "invariant X violated >3 times in 24h" → Slack channel.

### Rollout phases
1. **Phase 1** — static library + snapshot collector + read-only subset (10 invariants above). No scenarios, just observation of real staging traffic.
2. **Phase 2** — scenario runner (create/delete/trigger flows) exercising all Tier-A invariants.
3. **Phase 3** — Hypothesis stateful testing for scenario generation.
4. **Phase 4** — chaos injection. Only after Phase 1–3 are stable.

---

## Open questions (for research)

1. **Source of truth for state snapshots**: direct SQLite read (faster, no auth) vs. backend API (enforces real code path). Recommended: API for Phase 1, direct for Phase 3+.
2. **Clock skew across sources**: Redis time vs. backend time vs. Docker time. How wide should the "simultaneity window" be on snapshots?
3. **Isolating canary traffic from real usage**: synthetic email domain (e.g. `@canary.trinity.local`), synthetic agent name prefix (`canary-*`), dedicated user.
4. **Retention**: how long to keep violation records for trend analysis? 30 days proposed.
5. **Self-test**: how does the harness test itself? A pair of deliberately-broken invariants (known to fire) as liveness probes.
6. **Staging DB access**: do we expose a read-only SQLite bind mount on staging, or route everything through backend API? Security vs. fidelity trade-off.
7. **Reuse with existing testing**: overlap with `docs/testing/` existing frameworks (`MODULAR_TESTING_STRUCTURE.md`, `UI_INTEGRATION_TEST.md`). Where does this fit?
