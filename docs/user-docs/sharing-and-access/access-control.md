# Cross-Channel Access Control

Unified access control across all channels (web, Telegram, Slack). Verified email is the identity — approving a user once admits them everywhere.

## Concepts

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Verified email** | Email proven via verification code (Telegram `/login`) or OAuth (Slack workspace) |
| **Access policy** | Per-agent settings: require_email, open_access, group_auth_mode |
| **Access request** | Pending approval when a verified user contacts a restricted agent |

## How It Works

### Enable Email Verification

1. Go to Agent Detail → **Sharing** tab.
2. Enable **Require verified email**.
3. Users must now verify their email before chatting.

### Channel-Specific Verification

| Channel | How Email is Verified |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Telegram** | User sends `/login your@email.com`, receives 6-digit code, replies `/login 123456` |
| **Slack** | Automatic — workspace OAuth provides the email |
| **WhatsApp** | User sends `/login your@email.com`, receives a code, replies to verify |
| **Web (public links)** | Email verification during public chat session |

### Access Modes

**Restrictive (default)**: Only owner, admins, and explicitly shared users can chat. Others see "Your access request is pending approval."

**Open access**: Any user with a verified email can chat immediately. Enable via the **Open access** toggle.

### Approving Access Requests

When someone requests access:

1. Their request appears in the **Sharing** tab under "Pending access requests."
2. Click **Approve** to grant access (adds them to the share list).
3. Click **Deny** to reject.

Approving auto-adds the email to your shared users list.

**The requester is notified automatically.** When you approve a request that came in over Telegram, Slack, or WhatsApp, Trinity sends the requester a message on that same channel confirming they now have access — closing the loop on the "I'll let you know once the owner responds" reply they got when they first messaged. Web users see the change through the dashboard. Denials are silent (the agent's existence is not confirmed to the requester). A delivery failure (e.g. the user blocked the bot) never blocks or rolls back the approval; the outcome is recorded in the audit log.

## Group Chat Authentication

For Telegram groups, you can require at least one verified member before the bot responds:

1. Set **Group auth mode** to `any_verified` via API.
2. When someone @mentions the bot in an unverified group, the bot prompts for verification.
3. Once one member verifies via `/login`, the group is unlocked for everyone.

## Telegram Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login email@example.com` | Start email verification |
| `/login 123456` | Complete verification with code |
| `/logout` | Remove verified email |
| `/whoami` | Check current verification status |

## For Agents

### Access Policy API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/agents/{name}/access-policy` | GET | Get current policy |
| `/api/agents/{name}/access-policy` | PUT | Update policy |
| `/api/agents/{name}/access-requests` | GET | List pending requests |
| `/api/agents/{name}/access-requests/{id}/decide` | POST | Approve or deny |

**Policy body:**
```json
{
  "require_email": true,
  "open_access": false,
  "group_auth_mode": "none"
}
```

**Decision body:**
```json
{"approve": true}
```

## Limitations

- Group chats with `group_auth_mode: "none"` bypass email verification entirely.
- Slack requires `users:read.email` scope for email resolution.
- Pending login state is in-memory — lost on backend restart (user re-sends `/login`).
