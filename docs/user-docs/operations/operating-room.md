# Operations

The Operations page at `/operations` is the single fleet-operations surface. It replaces the former standalone Health, Operating Room, and Executions pages with one tabbed view:

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **Needs Response** | Pending operator-queue items: questions, approval requests, alerts from agents |
| **Notifications** | Agent notifications with filters, stats, and bulk actions |
| **Health** | Fleet health monitoring (admin-only) — see [Monitoring](monitoring.md) |
| **Executions** | All task runs across the fleet — see [Executions](executions.md) |
| **Resolved** | Terminal operator-queue items (responded, acknowledged, cancelled, expired) |

Tabs are addressable via `?tab=` (e.g. `/operations?tab=notifications`). Legacy routes redirect here: `/operating-room` (deep links keep their query), `/monitoring` → the Health tab, `/executions` → the Executions tab, and `/events` → the Notifications tab. Non-admin deep links to `?tab=health` fall back to the default tab.

The navigation bar shows a single **Operations** entry with one unified badge: the count of pending operator-queue items plus pending notifications. The badge pulses when any pending item is critical or urgent.

## How It Works

### Needs Response Tab

Shows items from agents' operator queues that are waiting on a human: questions, approval requests, and alerts. For how agents pause work and ask for approval, see [Approvals](../automation/approvals.md) — that page is the canonical reference for approval semantics.

- Agents write to `~/.trinity/operator-queue.json` inside their container.
- A background sync service polls running agents every 5 seconds and persists items to the backend database.
- Operators respond to items directly; responses are written back to the originating agent.
- The first open item auto-expands when items arrive.
- WebSocket events: `operator_queue_new`, `operator_queue_responded`, `operator_queue_acknowledged`, `operator_queue_cleared`.

### Notifications Tab

Consolidated view of agent notifications (replaces the former standalone Events page).

- Filter by agent, type, priority, or status; optionally show dismissed items.
- Stats cards display pending, acknowledged, total, and per-agent counts.
- Bulk selection and bulk actions.
- Real-time updates via WebSocket.

### Resolved Tab

Terminal operator-queue items. Responded items stay visible until the agent confirms delivery of the response.

### Clear All

Each operator tab has a **Clear All** button (with a confirmation dialog) when there is something to clear. The action depends on the tab:

| Tab | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Needs Response | Cancels the pending items currently shown. Agents waiting on them are told their requests were cancelled. |
| Notifications | Dismisses every non-dismissed notification from your accessible agents — including any hidden by the current filters. |
| Resolved | Clears resolved items from view. Items still awaiting agent confirmation are kept. |

All clear operations are scoped to agents you can access, affect all operators of those agents, and are recorded in the audit log.

### Sync Service

- Restart-resilient sync between agent containers and the backend database.
- Manual refresh button available on the operator tabs.
- Cancelled and expired statuses are written back into agent queue files, so agents stop waiting on cleared items.

### Sync Health Alerts

For agents with GitHub sync enabled, the Sync Health Service polls every 60 seconds and writes `sync_failing` queue entries when an agent's `consecutive_failures` hits 3. These appear in the Needs Response tab alongside agent-emitted items, so a broken git remote, expired PAT, or upstream divergence surfaces in the same place operators already watch.

Per-agent sync state (last sync at, last error, ahead/behind counts on `main` and the working branch) is also visible on the agent header dot and at `GET /api/agents/{name}/git/sync-state`.

## For Agents

### Operator Queue API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/operator-queue` | GET | List queue items |
| `/api/operator-queue/stats` | GET | Queue statistics |
| `/api/operator-queue/bulk-cancel` | POST | Cancel listed pending items (`{"ids": [...]}`); returns `{cancelled, skipped}` |
| `/api/operator-queue/clear-resolved` | POST | Hide terminal items (acknowledged/cancelled/expired); returns `{cleared}` |
| `/api/operator-queue/{id}` | GET | Get single item |
| `/api/operator-queue/{id}/respond` | POST | Submit response |
| `/api/operator-queue/{id}/cancel` | POST | Cancel item |
| `/api/operator-queue/agents/{name}` | GET | Items for a specific agent |
| `/api/notifications/dismiss-all` | POST | Dismiss all pending + acknowledged notifications (optional `agent_name`) |

### MCP

`send_notification(agent_name, message, priority)` -- sends a notification to the Operations page from within an agent.
