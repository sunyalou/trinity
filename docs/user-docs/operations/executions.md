# Executions

View, monitor, and manage task executions across all agents. Executions are created by manual tasks, schedules, MCP calls, and chat interactions.

## Concepts

**Execution** -- A single run of a task on an agent. Each execution records: status, started_at, completed_at, duration, message, response, error, cost, model_used, triggered_by, and claude_session_id.

**Trigger Types** -- How an execution was initiated:

| Trigger | Source |
|---------|--------|
| `manual` | Tasks tab in agent detail |
| `schedule` | Cron-based schedule |
| `chat` | Chat tab in agent detail |
| `session` | Session tab in agent detail |
| `agent` | Agent-to-agent call |
| `mcp` | MCP client call |
| `public` | Public chat link |
| `webhook` | Webhook trigger URL |
| `fan_out` | Fan-out to multiple agents |
| `loop` | Sequential agent loop iteration |

**Execution Status** -- Every execution moves through a lifecycle: `queued` -> `running` -> `success`, `failed`, `error`, `cancelled`, or `skipped`.

**Parallel Capacity** -- Each agent has a configurable slot system (default: 3 concurrent slots). Slot TTL equals the agent timeout plus a 5-minute buffer. When all slots are occupied, new executions queue until a slot frees up.

**Task Execution Service** -- A unified execution lifecycle layer used by all callers (UI, schedules, MCP, chat, paid). Handles slot management, activity tracking, and input sanitization.

**Live Streaming** -- Running executions stream logs in real time via Server-Sent Events (SSE) to the Execution Detail page.

## How It Works

### Executions Tab (Operations Page)

The fleet execution list lives on the **Executions** tab of the [Operations page](operating-room.md) (`/operations?tab=executions`). The legacy `/executions` route redirects there.

1. Lists all executions across the fleet. Admins see every agent; other users see only agents they own or that are shared with them.
2. Stat cards show Total, Success rate, and Cost for the selected time window. Running and queued counts are always live, regardless of the window.
3. Filter by agent, status, trigger type, time range (1h to 30d, or all time), and free-text search over task messages.
4. The list loads 50 rows at a time; **Load more** appends the next page.
5. A "N running now" strip appears whenever executions are in flight.
6. A status dot shows **Live** when WebSocket updates are connected, or **Polling** (every 30s) as fallback.
7. Click any execution row to open its detail page (`/agents/{name}/executions/{id}` — this route is unchanged).

### Execution Detail Page

1. Displays agent name, status, timestamps, duration, cost, model used, and trigger source.
2. Shows the full transcript/log of the Claude Code execution.
3. For running executions, a green pulsing "Live" indicator streams output in real time.
4. **Stop** button terminates a running execution.
5. **Continue as Chat** button resumes the execution as an interactive chat session.

### Tasks Tab (per-agent)

![Agent Tasks tab showing execution history, success rate, total cost, and average duration](../images/agent-tasks-tab.png)

1. Open agent detail and click the **Tasks** tab.
2. Enter a task message. Optionally select a model.
3. Click **Send** to start the execution.
4. View execution history with status and duration.
5. A green pulsing "Live" badge links directly to the running execution.
6. Use **Make Repeatable** to create a schedule from any completed task.

### Execution Termination

- Stop running executions via the **Stop** button on the detail page.
- The system sends SIGINT first, then SIGKILL if the process does not exit.
- Queue slots are released and activity is tracked.

## For Agents

### API

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/executions` | GET | Fleet execution list. Filters: `status`, `triggered_by`, `hours` (0 = all-time), `agent`, `search`; `limit` (max 200, default 50), `offset` |
| `/api/executions/stats` | GET | Fleet stat cards: total, success/failed counts, total cost for the `hours` window; running and queued counts always live |
| `/api/agents/{name}/executions` | GET | List executions for an agent |
| `/api/agents/{name}/executions/{id}` | GET | Get execution details |
| `/api/agents/{name}/task` | POST | Submit a new task |

Access control on the fleet endpoints mirrors the UI: admins see everything; other users see only owned or shared agents.

### MCP Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `list_recent_executions(name)` | List recent executions for an agent |
| `get_execution_result(id)` | Get the result of a specific execution |
| `get_agent_activity_summary(name)` | Get activity summary including execution stats |
