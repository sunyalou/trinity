# trinity Plugin

Connect, deploy, and sync agents to the Trinity platform. Three skills covering the complete deployment workflow.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install trinity@abilityai
```

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `/trinity:connect` | One-time: authenticate and configure MCP connection |
| `/trinity:onboard` | Per-agent: compatibility check, file creation, deploy |
| `/trinity:deploy` | Deploy current agent to Trinity (lighter-weight than onboard) |
| `/trinity:sync` | Ongoing: sync changes between local and remote |
| `/trinity:create-dashboard` | Create or update the agent's `dashboard.yaml` |

## How It Works

### Step 1: Connect (One-Time)

```bash
/trinity:connect
```

This:
1. Prompts for your Trinity instance URL
2. Authenticates via email verification
3. Provisions an MCP API key
4. Configures `.mcp.json` for Trinity MCP tools

After connecting, Trinity MCP tools become available:
- `mcp__trinity__list_agents`
- `mcp__trinity__chat_with_agent`
- `mcp__trinity__deploy_local_agent`

### Step 2: Onboard (Per Agent)

```bash
/trinity:onboard
```

For each agent you want to deploy:
1. **Compatibility check** — Verifies required files exist
2. **File creation** — Generates missing Trinity files
3. **Deploy** — Pushes agent to Trinity platform

Required files (created if missing):
- `template.yaml` — Agent metadata
- `.env.example` — Environment variable documentation
- `.mcp.json.template` — MCP server configuration

### Step 3: Sync (Ongoing)

```bash
/trinity:sync
```

After making local changes:
- Detects modified files
- Pushes updates to remote agent
- Optionally restarts the agent

## Alternative: Trinity CLI

You can also deploy via the command line:

```bash
# Install CLI
pip install trinity-cli

# Initialize (one-time)
trinity init

# Deploy agent
trinity deploy .
```

See [Trinity CLI](../cli/trinity-cli.md) for details.

## Compatibility Requirements

Agents must have:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | Agent identity and instructions |
| `template.yaml` | Trinity metadata (name, description, type) |
| `.env.example` | Documents required environment variables |

Optional but recommended:
- `dashboard.yaml` — Custom metrics dashboard
- `.mcp.json.template` — MCP server configuration
