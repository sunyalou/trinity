## The Agent Development Workflow

Abilities supports a four-step workflow:

```
1. Scaffold              2. Develop                    3. Deploy              4. Iterate
/create-agent:*          /agent-dev:create-playbook    /trinity:onboard       /trinity:sync
                         /agent-dev:add-memory         trinity deploy .       git push
                         /agent-dev:add-backlog                               /create-agent:adjust
```

**Scaffold** — Use a wizard like `/create-agent:prospector` or `/create-agent:custom` to get a fully configured agent.

**Develop** — Use `/agent-dev:create-playbook` to add capabilities, `/agent-dev:add-memory` for persistence.

**Deploy** — Run `/trinity:connect` once to authenticate, then `/trinity:onboard` per agent.

**Iterate** — Push changes with `git push` or `/trinity:sync`. Use `/create-agent:adjust` to audit.

## What Wizard-Created Agents Include

Every agent created with the wizards includes:

- **CLAUDE.md** — Identity and behavioral instructions
- **Initial skills** — 2-4 playbooks based on agent purpose
- **Onboarding system** — `onboarding.json` + `/onboarding` skill
- **Dashboard** — `dashboard.yaml` + `/update-dashboard` skill
- **Trinity files** — `template.yaml`, `.env.example`, `.mcp.json.template`
- **Git repo** — Initialized and committed
