# dev-methodology Plugin

Documentation-driven development methodology for any codebase. Enforces a structured development cycle: context loading, development, testing, documentation, and PR validation.

## Installation

```bash
/plugin install dev-methodology@abilityai
```

## Skills

| `/dev-methodology:release` | Cut a release — changelog, version bump, tag, merge |
| `/dev-methodology:security-check` | Quick security scan |
| `/dev-methodology:security-analysis` | Deep OWASP-based security analysis |
| `/dev-methodology:cso` | Chief Security Officer audit — infrastructure-wide security review |

| `/dev-methodology:refactor-audit` | Review changed code for reuse, quality, and efficiency |

## How It Works

### Initialize Methodology

```bash
/dev-methodology:init
```

Scaffolds into your project:
- `docs/memory/` — Architecture and requirements docs
- `docs/memory/feature-flows/` — Vertical slice documentation
- `.claude/skills/` — Development playbooks

### Session Start

```bash
/dev-methodology:read-docs
```

Loads project context:
- Architecture overview
- Current requirements
- Recent changes
- Active feature flows

### Feature Implementation

```bash
/dev-methodology:implement #42
```

End-to-end flow:
1. Read the issue and understand requirements
2. Plan the implementation
3. Write code with tests
4. Update documentation
5. Create PR

### PR Validation

```bash
/dev-methodology:validate-pr 123
```

Checks:
- Code quality and style
- Test coverage
- Documentation updates
- Security considerations
- Breaking changes

## Development Cycle

The methodology enforces a 5-phase cycle:

```
1. Context     2. Plan        3. Implement    4. Document    5. Validate
read-docs      understand     write code      update docs    validate-pr
               requirements   write tests     feature flows
```

## Security Tools

### Quick Scan

```bash
/dev-methodology:security-check
```

Fast checks for common issues:
- Hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection patterns
- XSS vulnerabilities

### Deep Analysis

```bash
/dev-methodology:security-analysis
```

Comprehensive OWASP-based review:
- Authentication flows
- Authorization checks
- Input validation
- Data exposure
