# create-agent Plugin

Create new Claude Code agents with domain-specific wizards. Each wizard is a domain expert that asks the right questions and builds a fully configured, Trinity-compatible agent.

## Installation

/plugin install create-agent@abilityai

## How It Works

### Discovery Entry Point

Run `/create-agent:create` to see all 12 available wizards and select one interactively.

### Wizard Flow

Each wizard guides you through domain-specific questions:

1. **Identity** — Name, purpose, personality
2. **Tools** — Which integrations and capabilities
3. **Workflows** — Key playbooks and automations
4. **Configuration** — Environment variables, credentials needed

### Output

The wizard creates a complete agent directory:

```
my-agent/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Agent identity and instructions
├── template.yaml          # Trinity metadata
├── .env.example           # Required environment variables
├── .mcp.json.template     # MCP server configuration template
├── dashboard.yaml         # Metrics dashboard definition
├── .claude/
│   └── skills/            # Initial playbooks
│       ├── onboarding/    # Setup progress tracker
│       └── update-dashboard/
└── .gitignore
```

## Usage Examples

### Create a Sales Research Agent

```bash
/create-agent:prospector
```

The wizard asks about:
- Target market and ICP criteria
- CRM system (HubSpot, Salesforce, etc.)
- Research sources (LinkedIn, Crunchbase, etc.)
- Output formats (reports, CRM updates)

### Create a Custom Agent

```bash
/create-agent:custom
```

Blank canvas — you define every aspect from scratch.

### Improve an Existing Agent

```bash
/create-agent:adjust
```

Audits the current agent against best practices and suggests improvements.
