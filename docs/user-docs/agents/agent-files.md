# Agent Files

Two-panel file manager in the Agent Detail Files tab for browsing, previewing, and editing agent workspace files.

## How It Works

1. Open the agent detail page and click the **Files** tab.
2. The left panel displays a file tree with search and expandable directories.
3. The right panel shows a preview of the selected file.
4. Supported previews: images, video, audio, PDF, and text files.
5. Click the edit button on any text file to modify and save it inline.
6. Delete files directly from the file manager. Protected path warnings appear for critical files.
7. Toggle **Show hidden files** to reveal dotfiles (`.env`, `.claude/`, etc.).
8. The agent workspace root is `/home/developer/`.

### Content Folder Convention

The `content/` directory is gitignored by default. Use it for large generated assets such as images, audio, and video.

### Shared Folders

Agents can expose their workspace folder for other agents to mount as a collaboration mechanism.

- Configure in the agent's **Sharing** tab using the Expose and Consume toggles.
- Permission-gated: only permitted agents can mount a shared folder.
- Relevant API endpoints: `GET/PUT /api/agents/{name}/folders`, `GET /api/agents/{name}/folders/available`, `GET /api/agents/{name}/folders/consumers`.

## Outbound File Sharing

Agents can publish files to a signed download URL that works universally — web, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, email — without per-channel upload handling.

### Enabling File Sharing

1. Open the agent detail page and go to the **Sharing** tab.
2. In the **File Sharing** panel, toggle **Enable file sharing** on.
3. A restart-required banner appears — restart the agent to mount the publish volume.
4. After restart, the agent's `/home/developer/public/` directory is live.

### Sharing a File

**From inside the agent** (via MCP `share_file` tool):
```
share_file({ filename: "report.csv" })
# Returns: { url, expires_at, size_bytes, mime_type }
```

The agent drops a file into `/home/developer/public/`, then calls `share_file` with the filename. Trinity extracts it, stores it securely, and returns a signed URL valid for 7 days.

**From the UI:**
- Active shared files appear in the File Sharing panel with filename, size, expiry, and download count.
- Click **Copy URL** to get the link.
- Click **Revoke** to invalidate a link immediately (returns `410 Gone` on download).

### Limits

| | |
|---|---|
| Max file size | 50 MB per file |
| Per-agent storage quota | 500 MB across all active shares |
| Default expiry | 7 days |
| Blocked types | Executables (PE/ELF/Mach-O), scripts with shebangs |

If the agent has `require_email` enabled, download links enforce session verification automatically.
