# First-Time Setup

Install Trinity, create your admin account, and start managing agents in minutes.

## Concepts

- **Admin Account** -- The primary account with full platform access, authenticated by username and password. Created automatically from `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env`.
- **Email Login** -- A passwordless authentication method where users receive a one-time code via email. Requires an email service to be configured.

## How It Works

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Git (required for GitHub-based agent templates)
- A modern web browser

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abilityai/trinity.git
   cd trinity
   ```

2. Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` before first boot:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and set ADMIN_PASSWORD to a strong password (min 12 chars)
   ```

   The `admin` account is created automatically from this value on first start. If you leave it blank, a one-time setup token is printed to the backend logs — paste it into the setup wizard that appears on first visit.

3. Start all services:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy/start.sh
   ```

   On first run, this detects if the base agent image is missing and builds it automatically (takes 5-10 minutes). Then starts the backend, frontend, MCP server, Redis, scheduler, and Vector.

4. Open http://localhost in your browser.

### Logging In

**Admin login:** Enter username `admin` and the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` you set in `.env`.

**Email login (passwordless):** Enter your email address, receive a 6-digit verification code, and submit it to log in. This requires email service configuration. The admin manages allowed email addresses under Settings > Email Whitelist.

### Key URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Web UI | http://localhost |
| Backend API docs | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| MCP Server | http://localhost:8080/mcp |

### Stopping and Starting

```bash
# Stop all services
./scripts/deploy/stop.sh

# Start all services
./scripts/deploy/start.sh

# Rebuild services after code changes
docker compose build --no-cache backend frontend mcp-server

# View backend logs
docker compose logs -f backend
```

### Settings Page (Admin Only)

From the Settings page, the admin can configure:

- **Email Whitelist** -- Control which email addresses can log in.
- **GitHub Templates** -- Manage template repositories for agent creation.
- **GitHub Personal Access Token** -- Platform-wide PAT so agents can pull/push GitHub repos. See [GitHub PAT Setup](../integrations/github-pat-setup.md) for the recommended setup (classic vs. fine-grained, permissions, and ongoing maintenance).
- **Platform API Keys** -- Generate and revoke API keys for programmatic access.
- **Slack Integration** -- Connect Trinity to a Slack workspace.
- **System Prompt** -- Set the system-wide Trinity prompt applied to all agents.

## For Agents

### Authentication Endpoint

```
POST /api/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

username=admin&password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...",
  "token_type": "bearer"
}
```

### Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header for all authenticated requests:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:8000/api/agents
```

### Token Details

- JWT tokens are valid for 7 days.
- Tokens are invalidated when the backend restarts. Re-login is required.
- MCP API keys (prefixed `trinity_mcp_`) also work as Bearer tokens.

### Unauthenticated Endpoints

The following endpoints do not require authentication:

- `GET /api/auth/mode` -- Returns the current authentication mode.
- `GET /api/setup/status` -- Returns whether initial setup is complete.
- `POST /api/token` -- The login endpoint itself.

## Limitations

- Backend restarts invalidate all active JWT tokens. All users and integrations must re-authenticate.
- Email login requires a configured email service. Without it, only admin password login is available.
- Trinity requires Docker Desktop. It cannot run without Docker.
